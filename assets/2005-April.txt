Hi again Paul,

I did an ParaView build yesterday, just to verify the procedure.  Here  
is how ParaView can be build on a Mac using Carbon:

1. Download the latest Tcl/Tk binaries from :
http://tcltkaqua.sourceforge.net/
2. Install the latest Tcl/Tk
3. Download ParaView from CVS, instructions can be found here:
http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html#cvs
4. Make a ParaView-bin directory and run cmake.
5. Go into the ParaView source directory and delete the Tcl/Tk  
utilities as:
ParaView/Utilities/TclTk/ rm -rf *
6. Hack the CMakeCache.txt file (Change the following entries):
//The path to the Tk internal headers (tkMacOSXPort.h).
TK_INTERNAL_PATH:PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.5/ 
PrivateHeaders

//Path to tcl include
TCL_INCLUDE_PATH:INTERNAL=/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Headers
//Path to tcl library
TCL_LIBRARY:INTERNAL=-framework Tcl
//Path to tcl stub library
TCL_STUB_LIBRARY:INTERNAL=-framework Tcl

//Path to tk include
TK_INCLUDE_PATH:INTERNAL=/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Headers
//Path to tk library
TK_LIBRARY:INTERNAL=-framework Tk
//Path to tk stub library
TK_STUB_LIBRARY:INTERNAL=-framework Tk

7. Run make
8. You should be able to start ParaView from the command prompt by  
entering the bin directory and type ./paraview

Regards
Jon

Jon,

	Very nice approach. One more trick though. You don't have to 'hack' 
CMakeCache.txt if you do the instructions in this order:

0. Install cmake (cmake.org)
1. Download the latest Tcl/Tk binaries from :
http://tcltkaqua.sourceforge.net/
2. Install the latest Tcl/Tk
3. Download ParaView from CVS, instructions can be found here:
http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html#cvs
4. Make a ParaView-bin directory and DON'T run cmake.
5. Go into the ParaView source directory and delete the Tcl/Tk 
utilities as:
ParaView/Utilities/TclTk/ rm -rf *
6. Now run cmake (it should fill all var properly, basically taking 
system tcl/tk instead of the one shipped with paraivew)
7. Run make
8. You should be able to start ParaView from the command prompt by 
entering the bin directory and type ./paraview


How does that sound :)

Hi Brian,

.... not really any problems "competing" with volview are there....?

Since ,for example, MayaVi does volume rendering with VTK,
and thats free same as paraview...

I tried your tetralhedralize  workaround,
but All I get is still a solid cube the size of my dataset,
when I set the display as volume render for the output of the filter....
not the volume rendered virus I am expecting to see.....
as I do when I do volume rendering with MayaVi on the same file.

I have access to an ibm super computer here in finland and it would be 
cool to volume render very very large data sets using paraview
that is just too slow on a single processor even using a nVidia quadro4 
980 graphics card.

anyway, I'm looking forward to the future developments regarding volume 
rendering in paraview that you mention!

cheers

Dan

Brian and Don and anyone else interested,
  I am not sure whether this has been published in this form, although 
the idea has been bruited about in other contexts.  It is certainly 
something that I have been working on in my sputtering and lackadaisical 
fashion.
  The gist is that the placement of glyphs and indeed any other visual 
object should be dictated not by a computational geometry but by some 
measure of importance and value.  In other words, equal spaced glyphs 
and contours are not only lazy but also misleading.
  What I would recommend is that glyphs be placed such that they lie in 
the center of a region that contains a user-specified amount of 
"stuff".  For the vis scientist, this means doing a voronoi tesselation 
based on the "stuff" field.  For the flow buff, the obvious choice of 
"stuff" is variance, with a close second to flux. 
  Procedure (I would say flowchart, but the pun police are everywhere 
and I have a reputation to project)
   1) select regions devoid of discontinuities
   2) within that region
          for every original sample point, compute the distance weighted 
variance to nearby points
           (clever people would use multi pole methods here) computing 
Sij for i>j only.  The fun of 
           course is to find a compelling version of the distance 
between 2 vectors as a single scalar.
           For incompressible flow, the dot product works.  Otherwise, 
you have more options in
           blending magnitude changes with changes in direction. 
  3) do voronoi tesselation on S, or smoothed version thereof
  4) place glyph at center of polygon
I can root about in my files and look for slides from last year's DoECGF 
forum if there is call for pictures.

  Alternatively you can compute a LIC texture and then decimate at a 
user specified interval.  This is easy but morally unsatisfying.  And, 
unless you have taken the trouble to build in Jean Favre's 
implementation of LIC (PVLEA), 
<//http://www.cscs.ch/~jfavre/Projects/vtkLEA/vtklea.htm 
<http://www.cscs.ch/%7Ejfavre/Projects/vtkLEA/vtklea.htm>//>/ , /this is 
more work for you and the computer than can possibly  be justified.

Hi Jon

Many thanks!!

I put the paraview executable in /usr/local.

I found it needed TclTkaqua in order to run (without them it gave an  
error 'can't find file tcl... in frameworks...)
I downloaded the .dmg package installer for TclTk BI from the link you  
gave and installed (really easy!) and now it works!

I shall try to compile it myself from your explanation too, just out of  
interest.

Thanks once again.

Just a brief footnote here, the version of Jean's vtkLEA code that's on the 
web is not working 100% correctly with the cvs head of Paraview (or rather 
the head of branch ParaView-2-0 which I built a couple of days ago). It does 
give an output, but looks wrong and crashes when you twiddle the parameters.

I am hoping to fix this issue in the coming week and with luck put the code 
in a vtkCSCS cvs repository as soon as possible.

Thanks for this.  That was a help to distinguish files from directories.

The problem was I had an old NVIDIA driver, 5336, coupled with a mix of 
NVIDIA standard install vs Gentoo installations of the shared objects, .h 
files, etc.  (Gentoo uses ebuilds called nvidia-kernel or nvidia-glx  while 
NVIDIA runs a shell script.)

The solution was to upgrade to NVIDIA driver 6629 
(NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-6629-pkg1.run
from the NVIDIA download site), from the existing 5336.

This solved a number of symptoms that arose:  undefined symbol 
glBlendEquationSeparateNVX, API mismatch NVIDIA Kernel module vs X  module,  
and the famous "Could not find a decent visual" error.

Subject: [Paraview] which data format for paraview and opendx
Message-ID: <20050404104831.GA5777@ddorf.de>

Hi all,

I have some problems to decide which visualization 'toolkit'
I should use. So I want to use 'opendx' and 'paraview', and
now I am looking for the right data format for both
programs!?
Actually I was thinking about the 'hdf5'-format which looks
pretty powerfull, and both programs 'opendx' and 'paraview'
are able to read those formats.
I converted with 'h5fromtext' my 'tecplot'-data files, which are
asciii-formatted and have following structure:

x1 y1 z1 u v w
x2 y1 z1 u v w
x3 y1 z1 u v w
x1 y2 z1 u v w
...

I am able to open the converted 'hdf5' file, but any
visualization is not possible. Visualizing those data with a
'vts/xml' format works fine for me, but I am missing the
part where I can tell paraview the structure of these data.
Do I have to do it with a separate file? 

Do you have any hints how

Maybe, you can recommend any other format for both programs?

Best Greetings!
Fabian

Message-ID: <42526677.1070500@sachallenge.com>

I'm a bit embarrassed to ask this question, because it should be simple, 
but I can't figure out how to do this ...  Starting from an OpenFoam CFD 
solution, I reduce the 3D data in ParaView so that I have only the 
surface of a wing, now I cut the wing with a plane and I end up with a 
curve (i.e. a "wing section") which has got the info I need (pressure, 
etc.) that I can display as a nicely coloured graphic.  Now I would like 
to plot the values (e.g. pressure vs. x) as a really simple graph.  
Exporting the data would be nice, but there does not seem to be a 
simple, flat csv type of file export available.  Any suggestions?

Message-ID: <42527D7F.8040606@cscs.ch>

I'm testing vtkLEA and when I load it under windows (linux it loads ok), 
I can see in the debugger output that the dll is loaded and then unloaded

'paraview.exe': Loaded 'C:\Documents and Settings\biddisco\My 
Documents\cmakebuild\cscsp\bin\debug\vtkLEACS.dll', Symbols loaded.
'paraview.exe': Unloaded 'C:\Documents and Settings\biddisco\My

This happens on startup or if I manually tell it to load the packages.

Can anyone give me clues on either
a) Where to look in Paraview source to see for what reason the dll is 
being unloaded
b) tell me what the most likely problem is

I can see using dependency checker that the vtkLEACS and vtkLEA dll's 
are fine with no missing imports etc and all required stuff is on path. 
No error messages are being output as far as I can tell.

cheers

Charles,

	As far as I know there is no such functionality. The only thing you can 
do (if you use ParaView from latest 2.0 branch) is to use probe filter. 
I recently added the ability to export the XYPlot to a CSV file.

Very confusing. As far as I know, there is no code in paraview that
will unload a module/library. The library is loaded at:

int vtkPVXMLPackageParser::LoadPackageLibrary(vtkPVXMLElement* le)

Can you track with the debugger what happens after that?

Message-ID: <4252CEA4.1050008@btinternet.com>

I just recently started using paraview-2.0 in parallel mode.
I sometimes encounter a strange error where a secondary window called 
"Vizualisation Toolkit - OpenGL" pops onto the screen. Thereafter the 
main display is all messed up with a strange mapping occurring between 
the primary and pop-up displays.

I am using the standard linux nVidia driver from the Suse 9.2 distro 
with the "Backingstore" option enabled.

Has anyone else encountered this issue? Will updating/disabling the 
nVidia driver help?

This is not an issue. It is a feature. ParaView has a few modes of
rendering when running in parallel:

1. local on client
2. distributed
3. distributed on server
4. distributed on render server
5. distributed on tiled display
6. local (redistributed) on tiled display

These are described in more detail in the ParaView Guide. I will
describe 1 & 2 briefly:
1. geometry from all nodes is collected to the first node and rendered locally
2. all nodes render and the resulting imaging is composited using a
z-buffer based algorithm.

1. is generally faster for smaller data and 2. is faster (and more
scalable) for large data. There is a threshold value in 3D View
Settings (Composite). The decision on whether to use 1 or 2 is based
on this value.
The window you are seeing is the render window of nodes id > 0. Also,
the compositing codes grabs the frame buffer of these windows and on
most systems, this only works if the window is not obscured. So to fix
your problem, either compile paraview with offscreen rendering
(describing in the ParaVIew guide and archives of this mailing list)
or disable compositing from 3D View Settings.

That is a known issue with Group Parts filter when using Cacheing.
To over come this bug, one can disable cacheing (from the Key frames 
animation pane | Animation Settings).

Dear All,

   I have developed a simple vtk python application in which I would like to 
provide a functionality wherein the user can specify the center of rotation. 
  This is similar to what is there in Paraview.  I started with 
vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera but then it always uses the screen center 
as the center of rotation.
I noticed that paraview has a class called 
"vtkPVInteractorStyleCenterOfRotation".  I couldn't quite understood how it 
is implemented.  Has anyone implemented its equivalent in vtk with python 
wrappers.
Or is there any other way to implement this functionality.

Ravi

If you are running in client/server mode, specify --server-host=hostname on 
the command line.  If you are using separate data and render servers, use 
--data-server-host and --render-server-host.  You can find the list of 
command-line arguments for pvclient by running ./pvclient --help.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkPVInteractorStyleCenterOfRotation
Message-ID: <BAY12-F341573F39188CC14C4379D43F0@phx.gbl>

Dear all,

I am trying to have functionality analogous to 
vtkPVInteractorStyleCenterOfRotation in my simple vtkpython application, 
i.e, I should be able specify the center of rotation in multiple ways.

Currently I am using the TrackballCamera interactor and the center of 
rotation is always the center of the screen and not the center of the 
actor(s).  After some digging I found vtkPVInteractorStyleCenterOfRotation 
in the paraview source code. Has any one implemented this in python or any 
input on implementing this will be really helpful.

regards
Ravi

Subject: [Paraview] automatic animation 
Message-ID: <425B866B.40400@cscs.ch>

Hello,

On page 78 of the book it says that if an animation has been created, 
then batch mode will run it, however it doesn't seem to work 
(ParaView-2-0 branch yesterday build). If I load paraview with a .pvs 
file on the command line it loads up exactly as I'd like to see it, but 
I'd like it to automatically play the animation too. I'd like to set 
some animations running on unattended (keyboard and mouseless) machines 
and have them started and stopped via scripts.

Is there a command line option that will let me start playing an 
animation automatically once the pipeline setup is completed? If not, 
can I add one? (The new animation interface is very nice).

thanks

JB

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20050412133100.03c25e90@pop.biz.rr.com>

Dear ParaView users and developers,

The ParaView 2.0.1 release is now available for download from the ParaView 
web site: http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html. There are several 
changes included in this release.

1) The size of the precompiled binary files for linux has been 
significantly reduced. The .gz file went from 64.3 MB to 22.1 MB. The .Z 
one is down to 33.7 MB from 108 MB.
2) When "Play Demo" is selected from the Help menu, the Demo1.pvs file is 
correctly located, and the demo runs.
3) On Windows, all the ParaView-related executables are included in the 
precompiled binaries.
4) On Windows, the Uninstall executable actually uninstalls ParaView 
(including removing it from the Start menu and the registry).
5) The auto-accept feature has been turned off for the array calculator. 
Using auto-accept with this filter caused ParaView to produce errors 
because it tried to evaluate the expression in the calculator before it had 
been completely entered (bug #1549).
6) The problem with Cache Geometry in animation in client / server mode 
where the animated parameter stops changing has been corrected (bug #1502).
7) Clicking the "Label Point Ids" check box no longer crashes the 
application (bug #1657).
8) When probing with a line, you can now select which array(s) to display 
in the XY plot. The results can be exported to a CSV file, which is 
readable by MS Excel.
9) The PVD reader loads all parts, not just the first one (bug #1742).
10) In pvTestDriver.cxx (used in ParaView's regression testing), a 
correction was made to the code determining which tests are allowed to have 
errors and still pass.
11) The "Save SM State" item has been removed from the File menu. This is a 
development feature and was not intended for the release.

We hope you enjoy this new release of ParaView.

- Amy

Subject: [Paraview] compiling paraview 2.0.1, include dir
Message-ID: <425D0390.4070204@chalmers.se>

Hi!

I have just finished compiling version 2.0.1 of paraview (a relase version with shared libs). 
with the aid of cmake. When I do "make install" after the compilation, I get the directories
/bin /share and /lib in my install directory as expected. However when I build the 1.8.5-version of 
paraview I also get a /include directory for the header files, and a "vtk/" subdirectory in /lib 
which now seems to be missing. 

The custom reader I am using is expecting the files in the now missing directories. Any ideas as to how I should 
adopt to the new paraview-version?

Best regards
Rasmus Hemph

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0504131448040.27521@sampo.csc.fi>

I am trying to use (build) ParaView with MPI support
on IBM p690, AIX 5.2. I use cmake-2.0.5, IBM compiler
xlC_r and xlc_r (VisualAge Compiler Version 6) + IBM make

I used flags like (from CMakeCache.txt)

VTK_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/include
MPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/lib/libmpi_r.a
MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/lib/libppe_r.a

But I do not know where to add flags like:
-binitfini:poe_remote_main

IBM MPI compiler scripts mpCC_r or mpcc_r add
the above flag but Cmake do not support
mpCC_r or mpcc_r.

I tried to build ParaView without the flag:  -binitfini:poe_remote_main
The build had no errors, but
I was NOT able to run the paraview
(with Parallel Operating Environment, poe).

I did not have problems to build and run
ParaView if I turned MPI support off
(VTK_USE_MPI:BOOL=OFF)

Any help is appreciated.

The installation of development files is now an option that is off by 
default.  In fact it has been disabled in the source because its 
implementation is incomplete.  VTK headers are installed but ParaView 
headers are not.

You have two options:

1.) Build your custom reader against the BUILD tree of ParaView instead 
of the install tree.  Just specify ParaView_DIR as the root of the build 
tree.

2.) Edit the source to enable installation of development files.  The 
code below is from the top-level CMakeLists.txt file.  Just uncommnet 
the OPTION line and the option to install development files will be 
enabled.  Then you can turn it on when running CMake.

# Install no development files by default, but allow the user to get
# them installed by setting PV_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT to true.  Disable

I actually have the same problem for some hdf5 files. Unfortunately I
don't know the reason for that. Maybe, there exist different hdf5
formats which paraview can't handle!?

Does anybody have an idea?

Thomas,

Are you using the vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter class?  There are some pieces of test code in the documentation that will show you how to use the class.  If you have trouble, let me know and I'll find a code snipet.

The problem is I am not using the vtk code at all, I am trying to write 
my own small code snippet to export something for paraview to read.

ascii is no problem (to write/read), but I want to get smaller file and 
hence use compression (and base64 encoding fore readability). Preferably 
I want to have the datablocks inline.

So what are the format of such blocks for encoded only and compressed + 
encoded ? It seems there is supposed to be a small header part followed 
by the data. So far I tried the following, all base64 encoded (and with 
no luck):

- no header, inline
- no header, all data in one array before encoding
- no header, every data encoded separately in the appended array
- header (4 byte int) consisting av data size in bytes together with
   data encoded inline
- header and data encoded sepparately inline

all help would be appriciated.

I did manage to output the old binary format for a 3D mesh + data so if 
you want information on that...

I haven't managed yet to output binary and/or compressed in the new XML 
format. What a b.... to write! (unless you want to link in vtk) Like you 
I did manage the ascii XML. How do you do base64 encoding?

Kind regards,

I have not followed this thread, but wanted to offer an example binary 
file that is readable by Paraview using the xml format. The major 
trick for me was to realize that at the head of each binary segment, 
the length of that segment, in integer format, comes first. The 
documentation was very clear about the '_' character, but the rest 
appeared a bit vague to me. Also, the encoding is "raw" rather than 
"binary". Go figure;-)

File with binary section truncated is attached.

Subject: [Paraview] Re: Problem with paraview rendering HDF5 Image data
Message-ID: <4261CDFC.000005.10320@bjapp17>

I have done some test.I store three HDF5 files with the same metadata and only different is the dimensions of dataset.The results is like this:
1)   When I loaded the HDF5 image data of 2D (2 Dims data )
Paraview said " Found supported dataset:..."
but in the "Imformation" tab of paraview as like this

The Statics  
Type: Volume (Uinform Rectilinear)
Number of cells: 0
Number of points: 0

2)   When I loaded the HDF5 image data of 4D(4 Dims data )
anybody have advise ?

ErrorMessage end

Subject: [Paraview] Re: Problem with paraview rendering HDF5 Image data
Message-ID: <4261D2AF.0000F6.25766@bjapp17>

I has done some test.I store three HDF5 files with the same metadata and only different is the dimensions of dataset.
The results are like this:
1)   When I loaded the HDF5 image data of 2D (2 Dims data )
Paraview said " Found supported dataset:..."
but in the "Imformation" tab of paraview as like this

The Statics  
Type: Volume (Uinform Rectilinear)
Number of cells: 0
Number of points: 0

2)   When I loaded the HDF5 image data of 4D(4 Dims data )
anybody have advise ?
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: /usr/local/paraview-1.8.2/Servers/Filters/vtkHDF5RawImageReader.cxx (251)
 File "/usr/local/bin/SDS2.h5" contains no supported data sets.
ErrorMessage end
In the "Imformation" tab of paraview as like this

The Statics  
Type: Volume (Uinform Rectilinear)
Number of cells: 0
Number of points: 0

3)  When I loaded the HDF5 image data of 3D (3 Dims data)
paraview can rendering it.

Subject: [Paraview] Extending ParaView unsing existing VTK sources anf
	filters.
Message-ID: <200504190141.j3J1fY8R003006@trado.ucc.usyd.edu.au>

It is not clear from the ParaView manual how to extend ParaView using
existing VTK sources and filters.

Do I:
1) Create a new directory somewhere and define PV_INTERFACE_PATH to point to
it?
2) Create a file called myfilters.xml with entries in it like:
   <ModuleInterfaces>
   <Module name="" ...
...
   </Module>
   </ModuleInterfaces>

I have looked at:
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2003-September/000290.html

But I think this is more for when you create your own code.

Has anyone any pointers on how to do this for existing VTK code such as 
vtkParametricMobius (a source) or vtkQuantizePolyData (a filter)?

If I manage to get the vtk sources or filters into ParaView will static
linking still work?

What about parallelization? Some filters are not parallelizable - will this
affect ParaView?

Thanks for any comments.

Andrew

Hi Andrew,

these are the xml files we use for our reader module. This is perhaps 
not what you are looking for (since it is about a reader, not a filter).

Maybe there is a section in the paraview book?

Yes, there is.  Section 17.3 is about adding the necessary XML to ParaView 
when you want to add a new module (reader, filter, etc.).  It also briefly 
describes creating a new library for the new module, but points you to 
ParaView/Examples/PVLocal/README.txt for more details.  Chapter 19 is about 
writing ParaView readers, but some of that information also applies to 
other sources and filters.

Subject: [Paraview] segfault during VolumeRendering of unstructured EnSight
	data in latest stable (PV 2.0.1) and CVS build (PV 2.1 -
	April 13 2005)
Message-ID: <cc005638050419091646c4b2b2@mail.gmail.com>

Hello - 

I am trying to visualize an unstructured tet dataset with 250K cells,
70K points using ParaView.  I can get the dataset to volume render
with the Bunyk raycaster in the development version of VTK, but both
versions of ParaView listed above crash with a segmentation fault. 
I've attached the trace file but it doesn't appear to provide a lot of
information to go on. Does anyone know what might be causing the
problem, and are there any suggestions as to what tools might allow me
to get more information on the cause of the segfault?  Perhaps a
favored debug utility used by the ParaView team or users?

The platform is an Athlon 1GHz running Fedora Core 3.  The build
process didn't indicate any problems.

All the best -
Ken

Hi Andrew,

these are the xml files we use for our reader module. This is perhaps 
not what you are looking for (since it is about a reader, not a filter).

Maybe there is a section in the paraview book?

hi,all

1) Can ParaView run in parallel on windows?  if can, how to do it?  

2) and how to run paraview in Client/Server mode in parallel? 

any help would be appriciated.

> 1) Can ParaView run in parallel on windows?  if can, how to do it?  
Yes, you'll need a MPI implementation, such as MPICH
(http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/). Once you install that, to run
paraview in parallel, the command is
mpirun -np 2 paraview.exe
(where mpirun is the appropriate path to the mpirun.exe installed with
mpich and paraview.exe is also the appropriate path to the paraview
executable, and -np 2 specifies two parallel processes)

> 
> 2) and how to run paraview in Client/Server mode in parallel? 

To run client server mode in parallel, you run the server (pvserver,
pvrenderserver, pvdataserver) in parallel (as above, using mpirun).

It is necessary to build ParaView from source in order to run it in 
parallel.  Then when you run CMake, turn on VTK_USE_MPI.  When you ask 
CMake to run configure again, it should find appropriate values for 
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH and MPI_LIBRARY.  If they have ***NOTFOUND values, you'll 
have to set them yourself.

Yes, it?s possible

I?m not an expert in Paraview, but I?ve already tested the Client/Server
mode in a very simple configuration (1 laptop and 1 pc, both running Win2k).
For Client/Server you only have to start Paraview in this mode. I?ve done:

PC (server)
Pvserver 

Laptop (client)
Paraview -c --host=[IP or name of the server]

This is the simplest case. If you have firewall you must connect the client
and server process with reverse connection, p. ex.:

Laptop (client)
Paraview -c -rc

PC (server)
Pvserver -rc --host=[IP or name of the server]

Note that in this case you must start the client process firstly.

For distributed systems you must compile Paraview with MPI support and it?s
more complicated... I?ll try to summarize some steps:

1- Install a mpi lib (I?ve been using mpich for Windows);
2- Download the Paraview source code;
3- Download Cmake;
4- Use Cmake to set up a proper workspace to Visual C++;
5- Open the workspace with Visual C++, go to build all and wait because the
compilation process may take too much time according to your system...
6- If you have luck at the finish you?ll have the Paraview ready to run in
distributed mode.

That?s it...

1) Can ParaView run in parallel on windows?  if can, how to do it?  

2) and how to run paraview in Client/Server mode in parallel?

Hi Ken,

The Bunyk ray caster is a serious memory hog - my guess is that you are 
running out a memory. You say that you have 250K cell - but what kind are 
they? If they are not tetras, then the mesh will be tetrahedralized - 
leading to many more cells. Then A LOT of information is precomputed and 
stored per point, cell, triangle face, etc. I'm not sure why your crash 
happens in ParaView but not in raw VTK - perhaps you are just on the edge 
of running out of memory in VTK, and with ParaView's GUI it pushes you over 
the limit...?

Soon (next couple of weeks) two more options for volume rendering 
unstructured grid meshes will appear in ParaView - one based on the ZSweep 
software projection method (slightly slower than Bunyk, less of a memory 
hog), and another one hardware based (much much faster than Bunyk or 
ZSweep) Hopefully having alternate methods will solve your problem!

Dr. Avila -

Thanks for pointing this out; I think this might indeed be the problem here - a stack trace of the core file is showing that it dies in the __Construct function in libvtkVolumeRendering.so and the two machines I've been running on both have approx 1 GB of main memory - I assume this function is allocating memory but haven't checked it out yet.  I just recompiled with the debug symbols on to get more info (I hope I'm doing this right - most of my debugging experience is with Borland and it is novice-proof) and trying a build of ParaView on our SGI workstation - it has a quite a bit more memory. The 250K cells are all tetras.

My bad for floating out my previous email to all if it is confirmed to be a memory limitation - everyone was a novice once though, right? :)

Best regards -
Ken

Subject: [Paraview] MIPSPro 7.4.2m build failing in vtkTimerLog.cxx with
	va_list undefined
Message-ID: <DB4EAB9D0D7E494A8BCBDE934487AD92A97BC2@1upmc-msx4.isdip.upmc.edu>

Hello -

I'm attempting to build ParaView on an Octane2 with the MIPSPro compilers version 7.4.2m.  The build is failing in vtkTimerLog.cxx with the following errors:
--------------------------
cc-1020 CC: ERROR File = /usr/local/VTK/Common/vtkTimerLog.cxx, Line = 137
  The identifier "va_list" is undefined.

    va_list var_args;
    ^

cc-1065 CC: ERROR File = /usr/local/VTK/Common/vtkTimerLog.cxx, Line = 137
  A semicolon is expected at this point.

    va_list var_args;
            ^

cc-1020 CC: ERROR File = /usr/local/VTK/Common/vtkTimerLog.cxx, Line = 138
  The identifier "var_args" is undefined.

    va_start(var_args, format);
    ^

3 errors detected in the compilation of "/usr/local/VTK/Common/vtkTimerLog.cxx".
*** Error code 2 (bu21)
*** Error code 1 (bu21)
*** Error code 1 (bu21)
*** Error code 1 (bu21)
----------------------------------

I have -LANG:std defined in the flags but otherwise have defined the MIPSPro compilers for the environment and left everything else alone. Looking through the dartboards for VTK I see what appears to be other IRIX machines running MIPSPro compiling VTK without a problem with similar configurations. Do any SGI gurus out there have any suggestions on getting VTK / ParaView running with MIPSPro?  Or should I use gcc?  I was planning to K.I.S.S. this one and add things like parallel mode, etc, when the basic setup started to work.

Your advice is both welcome and appreciated.

All the best -
Ken

We've recently encountered this problem too and are working on a fix.
This is the result of a bug in the system headers for that compiler.
The internal/stdio_core.h header defines va_list in the std:: namespace
and then defines a macro that prevents stdarg.h from later defining it
in the global namespace.  I've found a work-around which I plan to 
commit soon but needs more testing first.

You need to run a server and a client. On the server, run pvserver
with mpirun or your choice of mpi launcher. On the client, run
pvclient with --server-host=first_node_of_server
Make sure that you set the DISPLAY variables appropriately on the
cluster. How you do this depends on your environment and mpi
implementation. There are settings that control whether the geometry
is sent to client to be rendered locally or rendering is done on the
server and an image sent to client. These are on the 3D View
Properties page.
For more information, check the tooltip help as well as the ParaView Guide.

to a hard copy book for $72.  I am unable to locate an electronic copy of 
the documentation.

You need to run a server and a client. On the server, run pvserver
with mpirun or your choice of mpi launcher. On the client, run
pvclient with --server-host=first_node_of_server
Make sure that you set the DISPLAY variables appropriately on the
cluster. How you do this depends on your environment and mpi
implementation. There are settings that control whether the geometry
is sent to client to be rendered locally or rendering is done on the
server and an image sent to client. These are on the 3D View
Properties page.
For more information, check the tooltip help as well as the ParaView Guide.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview or ITK bug: Y axis appears flipped in Paraview?
Message-ID: <42692351.9050000@bwh.harvard.edu>

Hi

Please correct me if I am wrong. I am using the source code below to 
create a test image, which has pixels in the region cornered at 
(20,20,20) to (50,50,50) set to 1, and all other pixels set to 0. I 
display this in Paraview, threshold it to 1, and when I look at the 
resulting cube with cube axes visualized, the Y range shows as (100 - 
130) or something; i.e., looks like the Y axis is flipped during 
visualization. Is this a bug, or am I missing something? Or is it ITK 
bug? I am using lates stable release of Paraview, 2.0.1, and ITK  2.0.0 
(both Linux). Thank you.

Fedorov

 From where did this kwsys library come?  ParaView only ever installs 
libraries in PREFIX/lib/paraview-2.0.  Perhaps you ran "make install" in 
an older version of ParaView before all the proper install rules were 
written?

It looks like you've built both shared and static builds of ParaView in 
that build tree.  Once the shared libraries are present the linker will 
always favor them over the static versions.  My guess is you once built 
with shared libraries and then switched back to static libraries.  This 
would prevent the RPATH from ending up in the executable because CMake 
thinks it is linking in static libraries.  Then the linker finds the 
shared library first and adds it with no RPATH, so the dynamic linker 
finds one from the system at runtime.

Did you turn on CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH in this build tree or add 
/usr/local/vtk/lib/vtk to LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

I suggest you remove all traces of older VTK and ParaView versions from 
/usr/local and from any environment variables.  Then create a fresh 
build tree for ParaView and start again.

Subject: [Paraview] Possible bug in client/server mode regarding file
	opening.
Message-ID: <20050423001538.9006934BD3@public.kitware.com>

I don't know whether this is a bug or something wrong that I am doing as I
am not very experienced with ParaView.

Assume that I have machine A as the client and machine B as the server.
So on B I type:
pvserver -ch=A
On A I type:
pvclient -sh=B

Everything works OK if I use one of the existing sources like the sphere
source. Rendering seems to go OK and there seem to be no problems.

However if I try to open a file the server crashes with the following
message:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
pvserver -ch=a
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...
connected to port 11111
Client connected.
ERROR: In /usr/local/src/vtk/ParaView/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line540
vtkPVClientServerModule (0x9a7a420): Object type: vtkPVServerFileListing,
couldnot find requested method: "GetActiveFileIsDirectory"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
  Argument 0 = id_value {677}
  Argument 1 = string_value {GetActiveFileIsDirectory}


ERROR: In /usr/local/src/vtk/ParaView/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line542
vtkPVClientServerModule (0x9a7a420): Aborting execution for debugging
purposes.

Aborted
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can open directories on the remote machine and read/write to files OK. So
is it something that I am doing wrong? It seems to me that paraview is
unable to open a directory on the remote machine for some reason.

Thanks for any help

Andrew

That's a bug. Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Why the client can not be started?
References: <20050424160008.E2DD134B73@public.kitware.com>

Hi, all,
      I  am learning  to use Paraview for visualization of some data, and just download the version 2.0.1.
But when I test the Client/Server mode on two PCs, one of which is installed windows2000 and another is windowsXP,  the server is started normally, but the client can not be started. The commandline is as:

On B I type:
       pvserver -ch=[IP or name of  A]
       Listen on port: 11111
       Waiting for client...

On A I type:
       pvclient -sh=[IP or name of  B]

the process of  pvclient is exist, but no response appears on B or A.

While, if I start server and client on the same machine, everything is OK.

Is there anything wrong with my operation? who can help me?

Nancy

Subject: [Paraview] Nodal Values
Message-ID: <BAY24-F42DEE7C9F396B9C1A26DE987200@phx.gbl>

To Whom It May Concern,

I am working on a program to create XML files from element/nodal data to be 
read-in and visualized by ParaView.  So far, everything works great except 
attaching nodal values to the file.  Is there a way I can get a small XML 
file example that contains not only nodal connections and coordinates but 
also nodal values?

Thank you for all your help.

Sincerely,

Richard Haney

>From where did this kwsys library come?  ParaView only ever installs 
libraries in PREFIX/lib/paraview-2.0.  Perhaps you ran "make install" in an 
older version of ParaView before all the proper install rules were written?

It looks like you've built both shared and static builds of ParaView in that 
build tree.  Once the shared libraries are present the linker will always 
favor them over the static versions.  My guess is you once built with shared 
libraries and then switched back to static libraries.  This would prevent 
the RPATH from ending up in the executable because CMake thinks it is 
linking in static libraries.  Then the linker finds the shared library first 
and adds it with no RPATH, so the dynamic linker finds one from the system 
at runtime.

Did you turn on CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH in this build tree or add 
/usr/local/vtk/lib/vtk to LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

I suggest you remove all traces of older VTK and ParaView versions from 
/usr/local and from any environment variables.  Then create a fresh build 
tree for ParaView and start again.

Subject: [Paraview] one global structure
Message-ID: <20050426174341.GH1212@ddorf.de>

Hi,

I have a rectilinear mesh for my problem and want to write
out a lot of time steps in different files. This should be
no problem to do; I think using 'Collection' I can collect
them again; like this example I found:


  <VTKFile type="Collection">
  <Collection>
  <DataSet part="0" file="a_field-part0-{timestepnumber}.vtr"/>
  <DataSet part="1" file="a_field-part1-{timestepnumber}.vtr"/>
  ...
  ...

  </Collection>
  </VTKFile>

My problem is now, that I have to write the structure and
mesh data for every time step in every file which will
produce a lot of bytes. Is there a way to define the grid
and structure of all data-files global in one file, so that
the data-files just have data in binary format inside?

Thanks and Greetings!
Fabian

Hi Fabian,

Currently, there is no way of specifying the geometry and attribute
data separately. We are working on this.

It looks like your displays (DISPLAY env variable) are not set
correctly. The way to do this depends on the mpi implementation.
Something like:
export DISPLAY=:0
in your .XXXshrc file might work. Each node has to have access to a
separate display when doing compositing.
As I mentioned before, this is described in more detail in the ParaView guide.

The VTK XML formats were not originally designed with timesteps as a 
design goal.  Time support may be added but it is not yet implemented. 
If you want to do this with ParaView you can look at the HDF5 format, 
which I believe supports single geometry and multiple timesteps of data.

Thanks for your help.

I am using .bash_profile.  I have set DISPLAY=:0.0.  I am able to run 
"paraview" remote with rsh.  Paraview pops up on the remote with no OpenGL 
errors.

As you pointed out, there is no electronic guide/documentation.  Also there 
is no budget to plunk down $72 on a guide for 1.8 and I am running 2.0.  I 
find it strange anyhow that they would produce a retail guide for open 
source software that is updated/changed every couple months.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Hello Fabian,
 
I think you must consider the use of Ensight's case format. I've have been
using this file format to posprocess the results of my CFD program (three
dimensional incompressible fluid flow) in Paraview and Ensight. I'm sure
that this format support multiple time steps for one or multiple geometry
data. 

I've provided an example of case's file for multiple time steps below:

======================================================================

FORMAT
type:	ensight

GEOMETRY
model:	         cav51_2.geo

VARIABLE

scalar per node:           pressure      cav51_2_pres_0***.scl
vector per node:           velocity      cav51_2_vel_0***.vec

TIME            
time set: 1     
number of steps:   5
filename start number: 0
filename increment: 1   
time values: 
 0.00
 1.00
 2.00
 3.00
 4.00

======================================================================

Where: cav51_2_pres_0***.scl and cav51_2_vel_0***.vec are the names of my
result files (several files) and cav51_2.geo is my geometry file (only one).
Note the wildcard for the result files and the definition of the time steps.

For a short example of Ensight's geometry and result file (ASCII) you may
look into the files provided with the Paraview distribution (directory
\ParaView 2.0\Data\Data). If you are interested in Fortran routines to write
geometry (for tetrahedral elements) and scalar and vectorial result files in
binary format I could send my routines to you.

Assunto: [Paraview] one global structure

Hi,

I have a rectilinear mesh for my problem and want to write out a lot of time
steps in different files. This should be no problem to do; I think using
'Collection' I can collect them again; like this example I found:


  <VTKFile type="Collection">
  <Collection>
  <DataSet part="0" file="a_field-part0-{timestepnumber}.vtr"/>
  <DataSet part="1" file="a_field-part1-{timestepnumber}.vtr"/>
  ...
  ...

  </Collection>
  </VTKFile>

My problem is now, that I have to write the structure and mesh data for
every time step in every file which will produce a lot of bytes. Is there a
way to define the grid and structure of all data-files global in one file,
so that the data-files just have data in binary format inside?

Thanks and Greetings!
Fabian

Too sad. What do you expect; how long will it take?

I actually took a look at hdf5, but have problems to read
some examples I found; and none of those working ones did
have any 3D grid include. As I understand it now, hdf5 was
just intendend for 2D stuff. Now, there exist a mesh api,
but because examples did not work I thought that paraview
has problems with this mesh-api and lay my thought about
hdf5/paraview aside.
Am I totally wrong or did you have similar experience with
hdf5 and paraview?

Best Regards!

  Hello

  What are the plans about documentation of Paraview? If I understand 
correctly, there will be no more "manuals" from 1.6 onwards except for the 
book. Will be there a version for 2.0? How outdated is the book right now? 
and does the book give access to any kind of update info?

Hi Fabian,

My Fortran routines to write Ensight files in binary format may be found in
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview (EnsightRoutines.zip). You'll see
that is very simple to modify this routines to fit with your data.

Hi Renato,

thanks for your hint. I will take a look at it. Maybe, your fortran routines
help to get into it faster; I actually just have hexa-elements.

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20050427095325.02cdfb40@pop.mcs.anl.gov>


(This email describes (with one exception) results of running the paraview 2.0.0 executable I downloaded from the paraview web page, but I'm having similar problems with the paraview 2.0.0 source I'm changing with and building....)

There seems to be a problem with (at least) the "Scalar Range:" and "Scalars" widgets of the "Parameters" page of the contour filter.

All seems fine for the first isosurface I create of some data.  Assume the isovalue I've chosen is "ISO_ONE".

But, if I then select the data in the Selection Window and try to create a second isosurface of it, the "Scalars" menu contains "None", instead of the name of the 1st scalar, and the scalar range is "Invalid Data Range".  (In the paraview whose source I'm working with, the range is "<ISO_ONE> to <ISO_ONE>".

If I "Accept" the second isovalue, paraview crashes and the call stack in Visual Studio lists "VTKPATENTED" a couple times.

If this can be fixed by a simple source change, please tell me what that is so I can fix the source I'm working with, rather than downloading a new release.

Thanks.

I also agree I have just purchased the book and it is outdated (I think it
is for 1.8) especially regarding animation. There is now a completely
different interface. There needs to be some sort of online update of new
features as they are added. It is also very expensive for us in Australia (I
bought the full VTK set plus ParaView) and had to pay USD150 to have the
books couriered out - there was no other option just the 2-day delivery.
This was more than half the cost of the books!

Maybe registered purchasers of books should get some access to online
updates. This is particularly important with ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Animation ... does it actually work?
Message-ID: <200504280002.j3S02gYk024307@trado.ucc.usyd.edu.au>


I want to start off with a set of 20 surfaces and in an animation remove
them one by one. In other words, I want a peeling onion effect.

There seems to be no way of making a surface fade out (i.e. animate its
opacity). All I want to do is to set a start value for all the surfaces and
then select each surface and run its opacity from 1 to 0 over a second or
so.

I just purchased the book but what the book refers to is not in the recent
version of ParaView. The book talks about a completely different animation
control. ParaView 2.1 has a KeyFrame animation and something called
Animation tracks. But no popup help on what to do. There seems to be no way
of setting parameters dragging the sliders has no effect.

It is not a user friendly interface - it needs a lot of documentation.

Has someone done anything like this?
If so can they please give me some pointers.



Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Animation ... does it actually work?
In-Reply-To: <200504280002.j3S02gYk024307@trado.ucc.usyd.edu.au>
References: <200504280002.j3S02gYk024307@trado.ucc.usyd.edu.au>

I am attaching a paraview state file demonstrating how a "peeling onion" 
effect can be achieved.
Edit the file to set the variable "Vox8DataFile" to point to the 
vox8_ascii.vtk file provided with paraview. Then, try loading the 
session in paraview. If you get errors, make sure that you are using an 
updated CVS version of Paraview, (opacity animation has been enabled in 
CVS version (was not possible earlier)).
Once the session has loaded successfully, simply play the animation. You 
can use the VCR control (enable in Menu -- Window | Toolbars | 
Animation) or from the keyframe animation window (Menu --- View | 
Keyframe Animation) to Play the animation.

For additional animation interface tips please refer to:

Hi Utkarsh,

Thankyou very much for the help. 

I will look at it tonight/tomorrow. Is there any chance of putting the
Animation Tops in the mail you refer to below into the FAQ for ParaView?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Animation ... does it actually work?

I am attaching a paraview state file demonstrating how a "peeling onion" 
effect can be achieved.
Edit the file to set the variable "Vox8DataFile" to point to the 
vox8_ascii.vtk file provided with paraview. Then, try loading the 
session in paraview. If you get errors, make sure that you are using an 
updated CVS version of Paraview, (opacity animation has been enabled in 
CVS version (was not possible earlier)).
Once the session has loaded successfully, simply play the animation. You 
can use the VCR control (enable in Menu -- Window | Toolbars | 
Animation) or from the keyframe animation window (Menu --- View | 
Keyframe Animation) to Play the animation.

For additional animation interface tips please refer to:

Subject: [Paraview] Glyph Filter in PV2.0.1
Message-ID: <42708F50.8020706@gmx.de>

Hello

The sources for a Glyph-Filter seems to be reduced to Line and Arrow in 
Paraview 2.0.1.
I miss the Sphere and the Cone as sources for the glyph filter as in PV 
1.8.x

Is there any reason for neglecting them?

Best regards

I'm trying to visualize a velocity field with periodic boundary

My problem is that any streamline that reaches a boundary ends at that
boundary. For periodic boundary conditions it should enter again at
the corresponding point "at the other side".

Is there any chance to do this in ParaView? Basically the question
seems to be: does VTK support such a thing (because if it doesn't,
then I don't see a chance that ParaView will).

Or has anyone an idea for a workaround to get a similar behavior from
the existing ParaView?

Hi Sebastian,

This problem has been corrected on the ParaView-2-0 branch in CVS, and it 
will be included in the next patch release (v. 2.0.2).

I think you must increase the propagation time of the streamlines...

This won't help: as soon as the streamline "touches" the boundary
ParaView/VTK assumes that it has left the system (which makes perfect
sense for "outlets"). ParaView/VTK must have some information about
the topology of the problem (which is the opposite side at which the
streamline will "come back in").

I've finally had time to look at this (long train journey) and with the 
help of some of the files you nice people sent me (and the VTK source 
code) been able to write binary XML files of different flavours.
So here is what I found out:
Raw format binary can only be appended, base64 encoded works both inline 
and appended.
Noncompressed data has the format |Header|data| where Header is unsigned 
int 32 bits wide (call it uint32) containing the data size (bytes).
If encoded, all is encoded in one go.

Compressed data has the format |Header2|data| where Header now is a 
struct {uint32 blocks; uint32 blocksize; uint32 last_blocksize; uint32 
compressed_blocksizes[];};
For me the following simplification works:
struct {uint32 1; uint32 total_datasize; uint32 total_datasize;; uint32 
compressed_datasize;};
If encoded, _the_header_and_the_data_is_encoded_sepparately!

I'm glad to help with more info if someone needs it.

Although there is no periodic boundary support in VTK, this has been
done before. I believe Jeff Lee was the one. You might want to post on
the VTK mailing list and see if he answers.

Ignore my 2nd mail.  I HAD meant to describe using multiple contour filters of the dataset for the SAME scalar.

Also, I tested the downloaded executable of pv1.8.3 against that of pv2.0.0, and pv1.8.3 does not have the problem.  I tested it on the multicomb_0.vts data that comes w/ paraview.  I created 3 contour filters of the Density scalar, and in 1.8.3, the "Parameters" tab of each filter shows the same value range, whereas in 2.0.0, only that of the 1st contour shows that range.

hi,all

when a dataset is read into paraview by a reader, 
it can be processed by filters. 
After processed by a filter, there are 2 "dataset" in paraview--new one and old one,
we can select each of them in the Selection Window. Paraview must store both of them.

so  where is the dataset stored after be read by paraview? in memory? 
how does paraview maintain dataset?   

Thanks for any comments.

Hi Randy,

Can you provide any more information about the steps you took that put 
ParaView into the state you described?  I tried to reproduce the problem 
using the vox8_bin.vtk data set included in the ParaView release, but I had 
no problems with the scalar range for the contour.

I used multicomb_0.vts data, which comes w/ paraview.  

After reading the data, I clicked on its entry in the Selection Window and then clicked on the icon at the top of the GUI for isolines and isosurfaces -- the one with image of the concentric hemispheres.  I moved the "Add value" slider of the contour filter's "Parameters" tab and clicked "Add".  Then I clicked "Accept".  An isosurface appeared.

For the 2nd isosurface, I clicked on the dataset's entry in the Selection Window and then clicked on the icon at the top of the GUI for isolines and isosurfaces again. At this point, the "Scalars" menu and the data range widget were already invalid..

Hi Randy,

Thank you for reporting this bug.  It seems that when you try to apply a 
second contour filter to the data, only the second scalars array 
(StagnationEnergy) is available.  It's range (0.0 to 0.0) is correct, but 
the other array (Density) should also be available.  This problem occurs in 
ParaView 2.0 as well as in the current development version.  I will add it 
to ParaView's bug tracker (http://www.paraview.org/Bug/) and look into it 
shortly.

- Amy

Subject: [Paraview] Using ParaView to view Xmol format files for atoms and
	molecules
Message-ID: <00da2ce08b2ffd315c96fa6a2b7782c8@mps.ohio-state.edu>

Hello,

I was wondering if anyone else has explored ParaView as a means for 
viewing atomic crystalline structures?  The documentation says that PV 
supports the Xmol format, though it doesn't seem to work in the 
entirety of what I've come to know as the Xmol format in terms of 
animation.  Perhaps this is merely my ignorance speaking in that I 
don't know PV's command for loading the rest of the file into the 
animation scheme that it has... in any case, if anyone knows the answer 
to this dilemma please let me know.

Also, while I'm at it, is there a way to customize the displaying of 
the "atoms" with a database of information concerning the atom?  For 
example, a typical xyz viewer might have this kind of information 
concerning the atoms:

Atomtype atomtypes[] = {
...
{"Si", 1.930, 1.160, "Goldenrod"},
{"Sm", 1.760, 1.760, "Grey"},
...
};

This gives the atom size, minimum distance between two atoms to be 
considered a bond, atom color, etc.  Presently, using the line and dot 
plots in PV lacks the aesthetic that I've been spoiled with in my work. 
  =)

Cheers,
Joe Gorse

PS.  Here is an example of a very simple XYZ file with 4 time steps and 
2 atoms:
### Begin File after this line ###
2
# 1 line of whitespace, we usually put some lattice vector info here.
Si 1.358 1.358 1.358
Si 0.000 0.000 0.000
2

Si 1.358 1.358 1.358
Si 2.716 0.000 2.716
2

Si 1.358 1.358 1.358
Si 2.716 2.716 0.000
