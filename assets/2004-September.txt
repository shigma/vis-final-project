Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 1.4.3 in render-server mode
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0409011058110.32315@terra.mcs.anl.gov>


Hello,

I'm trying to run ParaView using the separate data server and render 
server, but am running into trouble.  I'd appreciate pointers to any 
additional documentation that may exist, the only doc I was able to find 
on it is the commandline options listed in the Users Guide, and by running 
paraview --help.


Here are some details on the problem I'm encountering:

(I should mention that I am running ParaView 1.4.3 in all places)
For simplicity, I'm running each of the servers on a single linux node.  
I'm not entirely sure that I've got all of the options correct, but here 
is how I am attempting to run things..

For the data server I run:
mpirun -np 1 -machinefile myDataNode.file /soft/bin/paraview --server 
--port=50100   

For the render server I run:
mpirun -np 1 -machinefile myRenderNode.file /soft/bin/paraview 
--render-server --render-port=50200 --render-node-port=50300

On the client I run:
paraview --client-render-server --host=myDataNode --port=50100 
--render-server-host=myRenderNode --render-port=50200 
--render-node-port=50300


The client appears to connect to both of the servers.  It looks like the 
problem occurs when the data server tries to connect to the render server 
(at least I think that is what is happening.) 

The render server gives the following ouput:
RenderServer: Waiting for client...
Client connected.
open with port 50300
WaitForConnection: id :0  Port:50300

The data server gives the following output:
Waiting for client...
Client connected.
Connect: id :0  host: localhost  Port:50300
Process id: 0 >> ERROR: In 
/soft/paraview/src/VTK/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx, line 453
vtkSocketCommunicator (0x81c7928): Can not connect to localhost on port 
50300

Process id: 0 >> ERROR: In 
/soft/paraview/src/VTK/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx, line 536
vtkSocketCommunicator (0x81c7928): Could not send tag.


Without more detailed documentation I don't fully understand what is 
happening, but it looks to me that the data server is trying to connect to 
the localhost, rather than myRenderNode.  Do I need to give the data 
server this information, or should it be getting it from the client?  I 
tried playing around with using the --machines option, but didn't 
see any difference, then again I wasn't sure of what the syntax of the 
file should be.

Also, when I tried running with multiple nodes for both servers, the first 
render node listens on the port I specified in the --render-node-port 
option, but the rest use ports presumedly generated by the render server.  
When I tried passing the --render-node-port a comma separated list of 
ports, only the first one was used.

If anyone can help shed some light on how to resolve this, it would be 
greatly appreciated.

thanks,
joe.

The documentation on this is still being written. However, I can comment on 
the format of the machines file. That file should have one machine name 
(result of command "hostname") per line. If you want to run more than one 
process on the same machine, the machine name should be followed by ":n" 
where n is the number of processes.  A sample machine file with 4 
processes, and two of them on the same machine would look like this:

machine1
machine2
machine3:2

I don't know if this is the cause of your problem or not, but it answers 
one of your questions.

You are on the right track. You have to use the --machines=filename
option. However, you should put this option on the render server command
line not the client or data server. The file should contain the
hostnames of all render server nodes (newline separated).

As far as I know, there is no way of specifying which ports to use on
the render server nodes. ParaView will ask libc to come up with
available ports and use them. As long as you set the machines file
properly, this shouldn't be a problem (unless you have a firewall that
blocks those ports)

Berk and Amy, 

Thanks for your help, things seem to be running just fine now.  Although, 
I would like make sure I understand how things work in this mode.  If I 
understand correctly, when you run with just a client and a server, the 
server computes the geometry and ships it to the client, who does all of 
the rendering.  With the client, server, render-server model the server 
computes the geometry and ships to the render-server, who does the 
rendering, then ships pixels to the client for display.  Is that about 
right?

Thanks again for your help,
joe.

Actually, you can specify the port used by the render server,
the option is as follows:
--render-node-port=11111

The option should be given to the render-server.
However, it is usually better to let the OS assign the port as
it will pick a port that is not in use.

Message-ID: <6.1.1.1.2.20040903143058.0c9acbb0@draney.pobox.stanford.edu>

I have an EnSight case file (with other associated .geo and .vel files) 
which I'm trying to read into ParaView. The exact same file read into 
ParaView 1.2 without problem, however, I get the following error in both 
1.4 and 1.6:

There was a VTK Error in file: martink ParaView14 Vtk Io
vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader.cxx (214)
Invalid part id; check that ByteOrder is set correctly.
There was a VTK Error in file: martink ParaView14 VTK Io
vtkEnSightReader.cxx (262)
  error reading geometry file

The error message in 1.6 is the same except for "ParaView14" being 
"ParaView16."

Since the file opens fine in the older version of ParaView and also opens 
fine in EnSight, I suspect the problem is not with the file.

Has anyone experienced this before and have any thoughts on a solution or 
workaround?

Thanks,
Mary

MessageAxel,

after ParaView 1.6 installation, I miss vtkDelaunay2D and 3D filters.
I have copied the "Extensions" dir from old 1.4 dir, and I set again the
PV_INTERFACE_PATH.

...I obtained the Delaunay items in Filters menu, but they are grey (inactive).

I wronged something ?
Do you have tested Delaunay on 1.6, also ?


Very Best Regards (and thank you in advance for help)

  Hi,

  I may be able to help you a little bit. First, you have to let paraview know that 
  you want to use the vtkDelaunay2D or 3D filter. This is done permanently (there are 
  some instances in the mailing list where people talk about this) for example 
  by creating a xml-file with the content (below) in a directory called e.g. "extensions"
  in your paraview installation directory. Then you have to point the environment
  variable PV_INTERFACE_PATH to that file location. If you only want to use this
  filter sporadically, then I think it is enough to "import package" the xml-file.
  This should make the filter available in paraview (given the right data format, I think).
  I am not sure what the structure of your VRML point cloud is, I use polydata such as this example

  # vtk DataFile Version 2.0
  Example data
  ASCII 
  DATASET POLYDATA
  POINTS 1000 float
  11.71441 -0.29446 -0.06840
  11.51223 -0.26540 -0.00054
  11.31058 -0.24298 0.00603
  11.10758 -0.28167 0.00724
  10.90453 -0.27109 0.00207
  .....


  and it works fine for me. If you consult the vtk description of the Delaunay filter, that might help.
  You can then play around with the parameters in the usual way.
  Alternatively, I sometimes use MayaVi, where you simply enter vtkDelaunay2D in the 
  UserDefined Filter window pop-up. Worth trying. 

  Hope that helps.

  Axel

Hello

I would like to visualize a vectorfield with paraview.

The data is seperated in x and y direction - ie. I 
have two vtk-files one with x compnent at each 
gridpoint and one with y component.

Is there any filter that allows me to combine these
two files to one vectorfield?

Message-ID: <413D8461.7090702@labri.fr>

Hi,

I'm using mangled mesa for doing some offscreen rendering in VTK and 
Paraview.
Lately I tryed to change my Mesa 5.0.2 for Mesa 6.0.
I compile with linux-static and USE_MGL_NAMESPACE.

The problem is that the static libraries that I get contain the 
"mangled" symbols (for instance mgl__unused413) but also references on 
undefined "regular" symbols (gl__unused413). On my 5.0.2 libs the 
undefined "regular" symbols don't appear. For the moment I will continue 
with Mesa 5.0.2 ...

Michael.

Hi Mary,

Is it possible for you to send me a copy of your EnSight files? (The case 
file and .geo file would be sufficient.) If you can't send the one you're 
currently working with, do you have a sample data file that exhibits the 
same behavior? If you can send such a data set, it will make it much easier 
to track down what is going wrong with the EnSight reader.

Message-ID: <a6bc6cc040907103553c1f59d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I installed Paraview on a Linux machine in the
/usr/local/packages/bin directory. Since I was compiling it from the
source code, I logged in as a local user and switched to root so I
would have the necessary permissions to install the files to the
desired location. That worked. I can run Paraview using my own
username or when I am running as root. However, when another user
tries to use it, they get the following error message:

paraview: error while loading shared libraries: libvtkKWParaViewCS.so:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I suspect that it might be a permissions error, but I checked all the
files and folders that point to that library and everything seems to
be ok. Is there a way to specify the library when I am starting
Paraview or link the library in statically? Any help in this matter
would be appreciated. Thank you.

It still looks like a permission error.

Can the other users read the libvtkKWParaViewCS.so (try e.g the 'file' 
command on it) ? Is it in their LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

I did the ldd and saw that it was trying to load the libraries from
the folder I created in my home directory for the "make" process.

I had another user augment their LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the path to the
folder in my home directory where the libraries were at. After that,
they were able to run the application.

While this is a workable solution, I'm still a little bit perplexed by
the behavior. I was expecting for paraview to look for the library in
the same folder the executable was put in during the "make install"
process. Indeed, the libraries that are in my home folder are also in
the /usr/local/packages/bin directory. That is the same directory the
paraview executable is in.

Thank you very much for your help.

Message-ID: <200409072329.i87NTP37029379@tingenek.stat.cmu.edu>


Hi folks;
  I'm trying to start up paraview in server mode under MPI, using OSMesa and 
offscreen rendering.  Things start up, but the workers still open and draw to 
windows on my display.  The command line I'm trying is:

prun -N 2 -n 8 `which paraview` --server --use-software-rendering 
--use-offscreen-rendering

and a number of variants thereon.  (prun -N 2 -n 8 is our system's equivalent 
of the mpirun command).
  My paraview is built with OSMesa enabled and 'nm `which paraview`' does list 
a number of OSMesa entry points.  What should the command line arguments be?  
Is there a way to see which versions of various modules paraview is using at 
any given point?

Thanks,
-Joel

Subject: [Paraview] Documentation for Paraview Distributed Options?
Message-ID: <a6bc6cc040908072511c5eb63@mail.gmail.com>

After resolving yesterday's issue, I'm moving on and trying to figure
out how to use Paraview on my organization's computer cluster. I've
been looking through the 1.4 User's Guide at the different options
that can be given on the commandline. Unfortunately, some of the
explanations for the options I am interested in are sparser than what
I would like.

Before I go any farther, let me briefly explain my computer cluster
setup. It consists of one main node and 20+ computation nodes. The
main node has Internet access and is primarily used to submit jobs to
the cluster. The computation nodes can communicate with the main node
and each other. MPI is used to provide parallel support.

I'm primarily interested in using my computer cluster for rendering
work. I'm thinking that I will have to setup one of the computation
nodes as a render server and have the other nodes connect to it. I
would then have the server and client run on the main node.

Looking through the options for the program, I am not sure how to make
this happen. So, let me ask the following questions:

1.  If I want to run the rendering process on 4 nodes, what options
would I use to do that? Do I have to tell one node to be a "render
server" and the others to be a "render node" that connects to the
render server? In the user's guide, I saw mention of a "machine file,"
but I didn't see any mention made for the format of the file or how it
was supposed to be used.

2.  Going through the mail archives, I saw mention of support being
integrated for a render server/server/client mode. What would be the
options for the client to connect if the servers are running on
different machines? It seems like "host" only lets you specify the
server you are connecting to.

Any help that can be offered would be appreciated.

After doing a lot of experimentation yesterday, I believe I found the
commands I need to use, but have come across a new problem (see
below). Let's say I want to run the client and server on COMPUTER1 and
the render server on COMPUTER2. I think I need to use the following:

COMPUTER2:
paraview --render-server

COMPUTER1:
paraview --server
paraview --client-render-server --render-server-host=COMPUTER2 --host=localhost

The problem with this arrangement is that the render-server on
COMPUTER2 thinks the server is running on COMPUTER2 and waits for a
connection from it. Also, it seems that the server program is looking
for the render server program locally. Needless to say, that doesn't
work and I get the following error message from the server program:

Process id: 0 >> ERROR: In
/usr/local/packages/paraview-1.6.1/VTK/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx,
line 453
vtkSocketCommunicator (0x9737b78): Can not connect to localhost on port 32850

In case it helps, here is the output from each of the programs:

[stout@COMPUTER2 stout]$ paraview --render-server
Listen on port: 22221
RenderServer: Waiting for client...
connected to port 22221

line 536

(repeat the error message ad nauseum)

[stout@COMPUTER1 stout]$ paraview --client-render-server 
--render-server-host=COMPUTER2 --render-port=22221 --host=localhost
Connect to localhost:11111
Connect to node27:22221

What do I need to do in order to get the server and render server to
connect to one another? I've tried lots of different combinations of
commands without any success.

Jeremy,

This problem looks very familiar, I was running into similar issues.  
Although, I am using mpirun to start both the server and the 
render-server, so I'm not certain whether this solution will work for you 
or not, but it's probably worth a try.  

When I start the --render-server, I also use the --machines=node_file 
option.  node_file contains the list of nodes that the render-server will 
run on, format of the file is one hostname per line.  In your case, 
node_file would just contain COMPUTER2.  So my commandline looks something 
like:
mpirun -np 8 -machinefile $PBS_NODEFILE /soft/bin/paraview --render-server --machines=$PBS_NODEFILE
 
If I understand the process correctly, when the client connects to the 
render-server, it gets this list of machines then passes it on to the 
server, who uses it to connect to the render-server node(s).  

I hope that helps.  
joe.

Hi Mary,

I spent some time yesterday looking into your problem with reading EnSight 
files in versions 1.4 and 1.6 of ParaView.  I was able to successfully read 
your data set with both of these versions of ParaView after I selected 
"little endian" from the "Byte order" menu on the Parameters tab for the 
EnSight reader.

Two things:

1. I think I've fixed one problem related to USE_MGL_NAMESPACE and an 
undefined reference to mgl__unused413.  It's in CVS.

2. Are you sure you compiled from scratch and didn't have any 
left-over .o files lying around?

I'm sure that I have no left-over .o but maybe I'm too confident in the 
'make clean' command.

Anyway, after a closer look in the symbols the only critical 'gl' symbol 
seems to be gl__unused413. But you say the undefined reference you got 
was mgl__unused413 while in my case mgl__unused413 is well defined.

# nm lib/* | grep "gl__unused413"
00004b40 T mgl__unused413
          U gl__unused413

Message-ID: <20040915014518.1648.qmail@web51106.mail.yahoo.com>

Hai all,
Just wanted to ask if it is possible to get paraview to get the TCL/C++
code out of whatever it is doing. Not the interfaces, but for the file
open / filters and things like that... I saw that there is a bathc file
that can be exported, but it needs paraview to run it... i would be
happier with a standalone piece of code that could run with just vtk !

Thanks
Amba

Message-ID: <248625640.20040916200742@lncc.br>

Hi everybody,

   I'm the latest fan of Paraview!!. I been looking arround and
   finded it very usefull. Now I'm trying to give one more step ahead
   and generate a small video or animation, but I have
   to use (on every time step) a diferent scalar (or vector) field. As
   I didn't find the strait-forward way of doing this, I presume that
   may be this is done with a TCL script. Is there any example
   (Paraview specific) that I can use to help mi self?. What are the
   variables that I can access from the TCL script (I mean, where are
   the pipeline data objects)?.
   
   Please help me.
   Than-X in advance.

   Nacho

Hello,
I was just guessing if there is a way to get Paraview write a Tcl/C++
code for what it is doing... just like the batch script it writes out
to files. I understand that the interface is going to be different, but
a generic code for whatever it executes in the back ground should be
easy to cout to a file... i guess... that is if it goes thru one
channel... can somebody help ?

Thanks
amb

This is not possible.  You will have to translate the batch script into 
pure VTK Tcl or C++ code by hand.

There is no way to have paraview write vtk scripts or programs.
You have to start with the batch file and convert that to a
vtk script. It is not too hard. First, get paraview 1.6 (source).
Second, make it write a batch script. Third, look at the xml
files in Servers/ServerManager/Resources to figure out which
"proxies" correspond to which vtk classes and which "properties"
correspond to which methods. For example:

batch script:
 
set pvTemp223 [$proxyManager NewProxy filters ShrinkFilter]
  [$pvTemp223 GetProperty Input] AddProxy $pvTemp269
  [$pvTemp223 GetProperty ShrinkFactor] SetElement 0 0.5

corresponding xml from filtering.xml:

   <SourceProxy name="ShrinkFilter" class="vtkShrinkFilter">
     <InputProperty
        name="Input"
        command="SetInput">
           <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
             <Group name="sources"/>
             <Group name="filters"/>
           </ProxyGroupDomain>
           <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
             <DataType value="vtkDataSet"/>
           </DataTypeDomain>
      </InputProperty>

      <DoubleVectorProperty
         name="ShrinkFactor"
         command="SetShrinkFactor"
         number_of_elements="1"
         default_values="0.5" >
        <DoubleRangeDomain name="range" min="0" max="1" />
      </DoubleVectorProperty>
   <!-- End ShrinkFilter -->
   </SourceProxy>

These together tell you that the filter is vtkShrinkFilter, it
is connected to whatever pvTemp269 is (a cylinder source,
vtkCylinderSource) and the SetShrinkFactor method has to be
called with 0.5. If you go over a few batch scripts, you should
figure out how it works easily. Feel free to post questions if
you don't understand how it works.

Message-ID: <20040917195601.YTVJ14657.fep03.biz.rr.com@Grayson>

We have tagged ParaView release 1.6.2 which includes a few bug fixes from
1.6.1. The new sources and binaries can be found at www.paraview.org
<http://www.paraview.org/>  (Linux and IRIX binaries will show up a little
later in the week). Some specifics include:

 

-- Some GUI fixes were made

-- Reading parallel files on a single node was improved

-- Using the cut plane on unsigned int data had a bug that was fixed

-- Scalar Bar and corner annotation now work with batch scripts

 

Thanks

When building 1.6.2 with gcc3.4.1 I had to change ProcessXML.cxx because 
of the following error:


Building object file ProcessXML.o...
../../../../../paraview-1.6.2/Common/KWCommon/ProcessXML.cxx: In member 
function `void Output::CheckSplit(const char*, const char*, int)':

ISO C++ says that these are ambiguous, even though the worst conversion 
for the first is better than the worst conversion for the second:

I hacked it by casting this->currentPosition to a streamoff: (probably 
not the right thing to do)

  (const std::streamoff&)this->CurrentPosition)

I have a small problem compiling the 1.6.2 sources. In

	Utilities/TclTk/CMakeLists.txt

around line 20 cmake (version 2.0.1) complains about an STREQUAL stmt. 
It seems to work fine if I replace it with MATCHES

Sorry about that. I believe upgrading to CMake 2.0.2 or later will fix the
problem. There were some problems using MATCHES with people who had "+"
signs in their paths so we converted to STREQUAL.

Hello,

(paraview 1.6.2, gcc-3.4.1)

After building paraview-1.6.2/Examples/PVLocal and setting 
PV_INTERFACE_PATH appropriatly and running paraview I get:

paraview
ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: Warning: In 
../../../../../paraview-1.6.2/GUI/Client/vtkPVXMLPackageParser.cxx, line 245
vtkPVXMLPackageParser (0x849d068): Ignoring unknown top-level element 
ServerManagerFile



ErrorMessage end

but it seems to work OK. Can i ignore this message? Is there any 
documentation on it?

Regards,

Mattijs

I am at the same point. It "seems" to work OK, but it does not work in 
batch-mode. I get the following error and ParaView quits.

paraview --batch /tmp/batchLocal.pvb

Errors while exiting ParaView:
ERROR: In

line 112
vtkSMProxyManager (0x8131828): No Proxy where found that matches:

( I use PV 1.6.2 and gcc 2.96)

The local package loading should work in batch mode and in save session 
state.  If it does not then this is a bug.  Please report it here:

Subject: [Paraview] Interactively manipulating 3D models
Message-ID: <BAY2-F81xwTz3SQKtDR000400dd@hotmail.com>

Hi,

I am currently visualizing segmented 3D data using VTK. Now I need to be 
able to manipulate these 3D models by: slicing them, translating them to a 
new position in the visual scene. Is there a way I can do this paraview? 
Also, can I save these modifications back to a data file? Are there any 
graphics techniques that I can use/implement in Paraview such as painter's 
algorithm for back filling empty holes, when I move these 3d objects in the 
visual scene?

I hope someone can help me and provide me some pointers to answer my 
questions, since I'm new to Paraview.

Thanks!

No, I did not manage to figure it out. But I did not spend too much time 
on it as well.

(but am still very interested in how to)

Dear Brian,

Thanks for the information. I checked out the Mesa CVS code, it did 
solve the problem.
FYI, Now I can build ParaView with mangled mesa without problem.

(trying to figure out how renderserver, server, client work now...)

Use --start-empty (or -e) option and create your own xml files.
However, once you do this, you have to provide all xml files.
You might want to create a PV_INTERFACE_PATH directory and copy
some of the default xml files (from GUI/Client/Resources in 1.6) 
there.

I can't :-) I never did it. Currently, there is no way of adding
exporters to ParaView using xml files. One would have to change
ParaView code to do it. If someone explains how gl2ps works 
(what calls are made to enable it etc.), I might have some pointers.

Hi,

the code below is taken from the Mayavi code (/Misc/RenderWindow.py)
from Prabhu (thanks!)
and defines the function for exporting with the vtkGL2PSExporter.
Does that help?

I can't :-) I never did it. Currently, there is no way of adding
exporters to ParaView using xml files. One would have to change ParaView
code to do it. If someone explains how gl2ps works 
(what calls are made to enable it etc.), I might have some pointers.

Not really. It doesn't tell me how the exporter is
connected and configured (I am guessing there are
some calls that has to be made before Render() is
called)

No trade secrets here.  Apart from the cruft I need to do to get all
the options working, its straightforward.

You just need to setup the exporter properly (with the necessary
options for the output format etc.), set the renderwindow, make sure
the renderwindow is not obscured or iconified etc.  In essence:

    ex.SetRenderWindow(self.renwin)
    ex.Write()

Write() calls Render internally and does other magic if necessary.
Its darned easy to use.

Hi,

I have some c++ code that I wrote as a vtk module. I need to somehow add 
that module to the paraview interface. How would I do that? I am fairly a 
newbie, and would appreciate some step-by-step instructions to do this. 
Thanks so much.

Have a look in the paraview source in the example directory at the 
pvlocal example. It is a new source but filters should not be much 
harder (look at how the existing one are bound in: 
./GUI/Client/Resources/Filters.xml)

(I haven't actually done it so this is all easy talking)

You may want to try the VTK Filter I have developped to create LIC 
textures for vector fields. It does also time-dependent texture 
animation. There is all the source code, the XML and the PVSM code 
necessary for ParaView 1.6.2

Caveat emptor: I just tested it under Linux.

Hi,

I'm a windows user, and I'm desperately trying to get my C++ code added as a 
filter in paraview. I guess I don't quite understand the basic steps here: 
what do the XML and PVSM code each contain? I tried using cmake on the code 
that you mentioned below, butI get a configuration error.
Could someone please provide me  step-by-step instructions to add c++ vtk 
module as a filter in Paraview?

Thanks!

Hi,

I still haven't figured out how to tie in c++ vtk code into paraview as a 
filter. Please help!
Thanks,

Vidya

I tried compiling the LEA code and it doesn't like the #include <iostream.h>
statements. I've commented out all std::cout << and std::cerr and removed
the iostream references so it now compiles under MSVS 7.1. These files are
the modified ones attached. As a future improvement, tweaking the code to
use the vtk iostreams stuff might be a good idea.

As an aside. When running cmake I got errors trying to load the paraview
cmake extensions
debugging with this...
    MESSAGE(Error "${PARAVIEW_VTK_DIR}")
    MESSAGE(Error "${VTK_WRAP_ClientServer}")
    MESSAGE(Error "${PARAVIEW_CMAKE_EXTENSIONS_DIR}")
the second two variables were blank strings, so the macro wasn't working. I
haven't fixed this as it's probably something dodgy with my local setup and
I couldb't do a cvs update because the kitware server seems to have a disk
full and cvs gave me an error.

anyway, try these modified source files and see if your code compiles.

JB

Running cmake from cvs a few weeks (month?) ago. Says 2.1 development in the
title bar. I think it's probably because my paraview is a few months old,
cmake is fine, its just the LEA project using the FIND_PACKAGE(Paraview),
then including things and something not getting set correctly. I'm sure
it'll go away when I can do an update and check it's all ok.

Subject: [Paraview] Sorry for the 2 previous posts (this is the one)
Message-ID: <1a6.2970ccfb.2e895ade@aol.com>

Sorry for the two previous posts I am new to the forum and it took me 2
tries before I realized I needed to turn on plain text.

Paraview - render-server/data-server

I have a few questions regarding Paraview and the way it works in
client/server mode.

My overall goal is to setup Paraview to distribute the data calculations
(e.g. filters, manipulation of large data sets, etc) and the rendering of
our data across a cluster of linux boxes.

I will start with what I have done:  I have configured Paraview with MPI for
linux (RH 9.1) and Windows.  I have configured a setup wherebye I run
Paraview in server mode and it distributes to 6 nodes.  Here is the command
I am using:  mpirun -np 6 -p4ssport xxxx paraview --server

The -p4ssport bit is a way of bypassing potential ssh problems that could
come up.  It simply uses mpich's secure server to run shell commands on
other servers, the only dissadvantate (I think) is that I have to manually
key in the passwords for each node everytime I start a Paraview server.

So.the server starts.I type in the password for each node and then it says
"waiting for client on port 11111" and instances of paraview popup in the
system monitor on each linux node.

I then connect to the server using the command: paraview --client  the
client connects successfully and all seems well and good.  I make a
ridiculously large sphere on the client and the system monitor on all the
nodes start to wizz up to 100%.  Then 6 tiles appear on the server machine
containing 6 slices of sphere.  Then the final sphere appears on the client
machine.

So.what is happening here???  Is the rendering of the sphere being
distributed or is the data generation of the sphere being distributed.

Does paraview supportdistributed data manipulation (eg, If I wanted to
extract edges on a very high polygon shape would it distribute the
calculation of doing this).  Or does it only allow distributed rendering of
the data once it has been manipulated on a single machine?

I have tried to set up a data and render server and then connect using the
-crs argument and it does work but only the nodes of the render server do
anything and the data-server nodes (the nodes started with the command
--server) don't appear to be doing anything.  But the rendernodes started by
the -render-server command seem to at least have some activity.

Could anyone please shed light on how exactly Paraview works in this way.

Is there some classic way of doing what I am trying todo?  How are others
doing this?

Also if anyone is interested in instructions on compiling Paraview with MPI
on RH Linux 9.1 let me know because it seems that there might be demand for
this looking through the discussion groups.

The setup I am using is a 6 node (to begin with), Athlon 64 3000 each with
0.5gb of ram and all running RH 9.1.  As the client machine I am using a
windows Pentium 4 system.  The version of Paraview is 1.6.1 and it is
compiled with MPICH 1.x.x.

Any help would be great.

Just a quickie to confirm that the cvs server has cleared itself and after
updating Paraview, the LEA code runs through cmake without any problems.

The data generation of the sphere is being distributed. Since the sphere 
you mention is high-resolution, it is likely that rendering is also being 
distributed, and that the resulting images are then collected together to 
be displayed on the client. The Composite slider on the General tab of the 
3D View Properties page (View menu, 3D View Properties entry) determines 
whether the rendering is distributed or not. If the model is larger than 
the size listed on the slider, rendering will be distributed; otherwise it 
will not.

It does both. One of the main points of ParaView is to have distributed 
processing of the data (including rendering) and to collect the results as 
late as possible (i.e., after each process has rendered its piece of the data).

In this case, the data processing should be happening on the data server 
nodes, the rendering should occur on the render server nodes, and the 
results should be collected to and displayed on the client. Example 
command-line for setting up ParaView in this way are shown below:

mpirun -np N paraview --render-server --machines=machine_file
mpirun -np M paraview --server
paraview -crs --host=data_server_host --render-server-host=render_server_host

The number of machines N (# of machines in the render server) should be no 
larger than the number of machines M (# of machines in the data server). 
The machine_file lists the machines composing the render server. An example 
is shown below.

node 0 machine1
node 1 machine2
node 2 machine3

When you run with a data server and a render server, do the various servers 
and the client seem to connect properly? If you load a large data set in 
this mode and apply some filters to it, do you see activity both on the 
data server and on the render server?

Hi Amy

Thankyou for a very helpful response. 

That clears up a lot for me.

> and the client seem to connect properly? 

Yes they do if I run the client on the same machine as the server.  If I 
run the client on a windows machine (or any other machine for that 
matter) in this mode I get a whole bunch of VTK socket communicator 
errors  (if I spent half a day problem solving this I could probably 
work it out but for now I am happy with a quick fix).  When I run in 
just server/client mode (no render server) I can put the client on any 
machine I want. 

If the server/client mode also supports distributed rendering then it 
seems that the only use for seperating out the render-server is to be 
able to use different machines for the different tasks.  Is this correct 
or am I missing something? 


>If you load a large data set in

I have been using Paraview's inbuilt filters and shapes to try and 
simulate operations on a large dataset...the codebase we are working on 
is not yet mature enough to produce any large datasets yet...I am 
charged with getting the 'distributed' infrastructure ready.  So 
basically I don't know...So far I can only see activity on the 
render-server side but this could just be because I am not giving it a 
hard enough time on the computation side of things.  Is there a known 
test that is both computationally intensive and rendering intensive that 
would be a huge help?  ...at the moment I have just been chucking a load 
of paraviews own filters at its own objects but this usually takes only 
a few seconds and sometimes crashes the machine the server is running on. 

Also I got the impression that it was difficult to use the GPU's to do 
rendering.  But it seems that the tiled windows that are popping up on 
my server are in fact using opengl if I am to believe there titles that 
run somthing like "opengl window".  Does this mean that the rendering is 
being done by opengl (and therefore probably the GPU) and that if I had 
  fast graphics cards in all my nodes the rendering will go much faster? 

I am also getting an error message sometimes in the clients terminal 
window which runs 'xlib: extension "xfree86-DRI" Missing on display ":0.0"'.

This could be that I have made an error during compiling paraview, I did 
use 64bit GL libraries, could this be the problem? 

Thanks again for the response Amy

Is the server behind a firewall where the client would have a hard time 
connecting to it?  Are you passing the host name of the server to the 
client using the --host argument on the client command-line. (The default 
is "localhost", which would explain the behavior you are seeing.)

Yes, the reason for using a separate render server is if the machines of 
the render server have better rendering capabilities than the machines of 
the data server.

Unless you have told ParaView to use software rendering (i.e., 
--use-software-rendering or -s), then it is trying to use the graphics card 
that is in the machine.  Faster graphics cards would certainly help this 
situation.

Hi,

I have checkout the source code of paraview using cygwin.
I do have a couple questions please:

1) Now how do I run cmake from cvs? I have cmake installed on windows 
separately.
2) How do I update the LEA code with cvs?

I'm new at this, and don't know the order in which this has to be done. 
Thanks for your patience.

No it isn't behind a firewall and I don't get this problem when using just
the client with the server, it only starts when I add the render server into
the mix.

Thanks that may allieviate the need to even use the render server, I'll have
to think about it :).

Hell Vidya,

1) you have cmake in your path and its version is >= 2.0.3?

2) in your paraview source directory there should be a README.html and 
Compiling.html which tell how to compile paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] adding c++ code as a filter to paraview?
Message-ID: <BAY2-F37i89QtpfTYSl000032f8@hotmail.com>

Mattijs,

I was able to build the paraview source in cmake, and compile in VC++ and 
generate the exe. Now, to include the LEA code in the source, how do I 
update?

Thanks,

-vidya

Subject: [Paraview] adding c++ code as a filter to paraview?
Message-ID: <BAY2-F33icUbvBDxroC0003c2ba@hotmail.com>

I guess my question is: where do I add the vtkLea directory in the paraview 
folder, and do I need any other xml code/files to include it as a filter?

Thanks!

I think you have to just put the directory somewhere and in there type

cmake <paraviewDir>

This should create a .so file which I forgot the name of. Add it to your 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, setenv the PV_INTERFACE_PATH to the current directory 
(i.e. where the PVLEA.xml file is)

Subject: [Paraview] adding c++ code as a filter to paraview?
Message-ID: <BAY2-F10m5PtAalwotW00012d9f@hotmail.com>

Hi,

I created a separate local directory PVLEA, and ran cmake on it, during 
which I get the error:
"paraview must be built with BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARIES_ON."

I've attached the folder of files I'm running CMake on. I followed the 
readme instructions of pvlocal and have corresponding.xml and .pvsm files.

Am I doing somehting fundamentally wrong? Thanks for your patience.

For the instructions in PVLocal to work, ParaView must be built using 
shared libraries. This is done by setting BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to ON when you 
ran CMake before you started building ParaView.  If your version of 
ParaView was built with static libraries, you will need to rebuild it with 
shared libraries for this to work.

Subject: [Paraview] Adding a renderer to ParaView
In-Reply-To: Your message of "Mon, 27 Sep 2004 16:18:32 EDT."
	<20040927201832.0F8A72D9A8@public.kitware.com> 
Message-ID: <200409280049.i8S0n9r4030393@tingenek.stat.cmu.edu>


Hi folks;
  I'm trying to add a Chromium renderer to ParaView, based on David Thompson 
et al.'s Chromium renderer for vtk and using the vtkPVIceTRenderModule as an 
example.  I have a few questions.

- Is there any documentation as to how all of these parts are supposed to work 
together?

- Is there a way to get the class hierarchy for the various renderer types?

- For a renderer named Foo, what are the purposes of the separate 
vtkPVFooRenderModule, vtkPVFooDisplayRenderModule, vtkPVFooRenderModuleUI, and 
vtkPVFooDisplayRenderModuleUI classes, and are all of them required?

- Should code for a new renderer be added to the Servers/Filters, 
Servers/ServerManager, and GUI/Client directories, or should it somehow be 
kept separate and linked in via cmake cleverness?

Thanks for your patience.

Signed,
-Groping In The Dark

Message-ID: <BAY2-F10KpDS7hx27kB00000873@hotmail.com>

Hi,

I looked at the error log, and when I tried to import the pvlea module, I 
got the following error:

There was a VTK Error in file: C: paraview-devel ParaView Utilities 
VTKClientServer vtkClientServerInterpreter.cxx (866)
Cannot find module "PVLEA.dll".  The following paths were searched:...
...............
...............
There was a VTK Error in file: C: paraview-devel ParaView GUI Client 
vtkPVXMLPackageParser.cxx (660)
Error loading Library component PVLEA


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I looked for PVLEA.dll on my computer, but could not find it. I tried 
loading pvlocal, and got a similar error: pvlocal.dll not found.

I basically, built the pvlea c++ code using cmake, and tried importing 
pvlea.xml package, and got the above error. Any clues as to what I did wrong 
this time?

Thanks,

Vidya

Your package must link against any VTK library from which a class is

against vtkFiltering.  The vtkDataSetToImageFilter is a class from 
vtkFiltering.
