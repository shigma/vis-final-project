All,

I believe this may be just another facet of the 'cache geometry' bug
that been logged for quite some time.

Bug #1502 - SNL: Cache geometry bug

If you turn off cache geometry this problem 'should' go away. Please try
it.

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.10.10502011326530.10114-100000@lugh.cacr.caltech.edu>


two questions...

	though i am able to create a PVD file, which includes
	differt sub-blocks of an AMR data set (as dumped from
	AMROC, see http://amroc.sourceforge.net/), the number
	of indivual files i include is too large for the file
	system to handly happily.

	so, i am trying to create one single file which contains
	all the sublocks, without having to explicitly write out all
	the connectivity.

	the failed possibilities:

	a) pvd: <Collection>... will include too many files, and there
	   is no way to include the data in the file pvd itself

	b) vti: <Piece>...</Piece> would work, except it does
	   not allow for different spacing per piece (the whole
	   reason behind using AMR).

	   also cannot put several independent vti blocks in one file.
	   anything after the first <ImageData>...<ImageData/> gets
	   ignored.

	c) pvti: see a) and b)!

	d) vtr: works, but the connectivity has to be dumped explicitly
	        which inflates the size of file by at least a factor of
		two, and makes it all really slow...

	e) from some notes on processing Zapotec files, it seems like
	   the are using a single XMF and a single H5 file, and are
	   able to load this into paraview...
	     http://www.arl.hpc.mil/ice/Codes/PostProcessZap.html
*	   QUESTION 1: is there a corresponding vtk/paraview format?

	i would appreciate any insight!

	also is there any document out there explaining what is
	valid for the PVD format? is information like part, time,
	and specially level being used?

	 <Collection>
	    ...
	   <DataSet part="12" time="05680" level="3" file="amroc.hdf5.05680.043.003.vti">
	    ...
	 </Collection>

*	QUESTION 2: am i using level correctly?

	(i did try to create internally in paraview itself a 3D "CTH AMR
	Fractal", and the write out the data to examine it, but it would
	crash without writing anything out...)

	thanks!

	(i am using version 1.9.r0 under linux)

We have currently chosen the solution of using a single HDF5 file which 
contains all grids of all levels for a single time step. It includes all 
spacing information, grid coordinates in the hierarchy, in summary all 
the meta-information which allow us to reconstruct the hierarchy inside 
ParaView in a vtkHierachicalDataSet.

Consequently, we wrote our own reader to decipher the HDF5 encoding. I 
am not a seasoned HDF5 expert, but I did not find that solution too 
difficult to build. Our HDF5 encoding is not final. We could perhaps 
converge together into an encoding acceptable for all.

Drop me a note for more details.

Jean

I want to integrate an OpenCascade viewer to Paraview.
What I want to have is a user-defined reader a la Ensight

Is this possible with the current version of Paraview?

Thanks a lot.

Hello,

Everything in astronomy seems to be radially or spherically

I am interested in stellar interiors etc. an would be interested in 
there were better approaches. My previous background has been mostly 
with uniform rectilinear (pixel based) data.

Any comments would be appreciated.

Farid,

	What are you exactly looking for :

1. Read some other file format VTK/ParaView does not support ?
or
2. Make ParaView link to OpenCascade to be able to access the structure ?

For #1, have a look at other readers in VTK, to help you start writting 
your own.

As for #2, have a look at the newly added abstraction layer in VTK:

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkGenericAdaptorCell.html
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkGenericDataSet.html

Those classes are empty nutshell you can plug to third party library 
(such as OpenCascade).

Ps: On a side note you can also have a look at my previous work to read 
IGES file using opencascade lib at :

The structured grid format is probably best, thought I've never worked 
with that specific kind of data.  You should also consider the 
vtkXMLStructuredGridReader format (.vts), which has much better support 
for reading in fractions of the data.

Message-ID: <4203CC94.1080203@as.arizona.edu>

Hello,

I have created a display of my radially symmetric data set using the 
legacy VTK file format. I would like to generate an animation from 
sequential frames of this data. My first approach was to include all 
of the data frames as fields in the VTK data file. The users guide 
describes fields as "essentially and array of data arrays".

I have purchased most of the books, and see no method for arranging 
the sequential display of these fields. I assume something as simple 
as this must be possible.

Thanks in advance.

Take a look at section 3.1 of the book "ParaView Guide", on page 25 
under the "Time Support" section.  Basically you can just write each 
frame to a separate file and name them sequentially:

frame001.vtk
frame002.vtk
frame003.vtk
...

and then load the first file with a reader.  The GUI will contain a 
Timestep slider to choose the frame.  Then go to the animation interface 
and choose the Timestep parameter to animate.  Right now this will only 
work up to 100 frames but you can edit the ParaView source to extend 
this limit if you need to (and we plan to fix this limitation in the 
future).

For more than 100 frames you can use the .pvd format to reference as 
many frames as you want.  Just create a sphere source and animate it 
with the "Save Geometry" feature.  Inspect the resulting .pvd file to 
see its format.

I'm trying to compile a reader I've written for ParaView 1.8.2, and am getting an error in a source file created by ParaView's vtkWrapClientServer.  

I modeled CMakeLists.txt on that of <paraview_source>/Examples/PVLocal.  I derive my reader from vtkSource.  I based the XML files on what I read in the ParaView manual and on the .in files in <paraview_source>/Examples/PVLocal.

Below, I've included the compiler error message, the piece of the paraview-generated source that's causing the error, CMakeLists.txt, the beginning lines from the header file of my reader, and the interface and server manager XML.in files.

Can someone suggest a solution?

Thanks.

In the next few lines, do you have
  vtkTypeRevisionMacro(vtkFlashHDF5Reader,vtkUnstructuredGridSource);
because that would confuse the client-server wrapper generator
into thinking the SafeDownCast call on line 19 of the generated
file would work (which it won't since you don't inherit
vtkUnstructuredGridSource, only vtkSource).

Subject: [Paraview] Composite Datasets
Message-ID: <42076973.7000009@cscs.ch>

I notice that when extract Parts is run on a certain file reader, I get 
7 objects out, each of these objects are a dataset in their own right, 
but they are stored in a composite dataset object.

When I pass this object to a filter, Paraview, (rather conveniently) 
extracts each of the individual parts and passes them to the filter, 
which spits out a result, the sum of which are then (rather 
conveniently) reassembled into a new composite dataset.

I'd like to be able to do the same procedure as above, but have the 
filter "know" of the other 6 pieces as each of the 7 is filtered. The 7 
datasets are nicely separated, but I'd like to use the ones not being 
processed to produce boundary conditions (if you will) for the operation 
being performed on the remaining piece.

Question:
Can I obtain the "parent" dataobject inside my filter. Is this present 
in the information anywhere. Once I have the composite dataset object, I 
can iterate of the children and get the info I need.

If not : Can I simply create a filter which accepts a composite dataset 
as an input, and use this in the normal manner (but spawning child 
filters in the same way as paraview is doing - any convenient code that 
I can reuse?) : Also if not. Is there any way of adding the parent 
composite dataobject to the information (some special key which states 
that this is a part of X dataset...)

also : I notice that the MultiBlock dataset has been removed. Has the 
functionality simply been put into the Heirarchical dataset and one can 
simply assume a flat one level deep dataset contains all the same info.

thanks

JB

Subject: [Paraview] Cut Offset Values
Message-ID: <01da01c50d17$034f1350$41c809c0@jupiter>

Hello,

I try to use Cut Offset values to define multiple cut spheres with centered shifted.
As it's explain page 219 of "The ParaView Guide" but I can't.
The cut planes are Ok but not the Cut spheres.

Is it a definition or visualisation problem ?
Could you explain me which parameter change between 2 "multiple cuts" ? (For the cut plane, it's the center)

Thanks for your help.

Hi John,

Currently, there are a few different ways paraview  handles composite datasets:

1. The reader produces multiple outputs. ParaView creates multiple,
parallel pipelines, one for each output. Each of these pipelines
function as a regular streaming demand driven pipeline. There are few
specialized filters that work on these outputs. One such filter is
extract parts.

2. The reader produces CTH AMR dataset. This is a sub-class of
vtkDataSet and can be processed by any dataset filter as usual. There
are a few specialized filters.

3. The reader produces one of the sub-classes of vtkCompositeDataSet.
Only one pipeline is created and the pipeline handles the iteration.
There are a few specialized filters.

1 and 2 came first and are more stable. I have been working on 3 and
recently added my first implementation to paraview. In time, 3 will
replace 1 and 2 (therefore is the recommended approach). However, it
is still in its infancy and requires more work.

> Question:

Yes you can. The composite data object is stored with the
vtkCompositeDataSet::COMPOSITE_DATA_SET() key and can be accessed as
follows:

  vtkInformation* inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);

  vtkCompositeDataSet *hdInput = vtkCompositeDataSet::SafeDownCast(
    inInfo->Get(vtkCompositeDataSet::COMPOSITE_DATA_SET()));

You can do this too.  I am going to write a few simple examples and
let you know.

Correct. Once I made vtkHierarchicalDataSet concrete, there was no
need for vtkMultiBlockDataSet. If, in the future, we want an API
without level, we can subclass from vtkHierarchicalDataSet and force
the number of levels to be 1.

Can you elaborate a bit? It works ok for me. I believe the offset
value is the distance from the surface of the actual sphere. I didn't
check but the default range provided by paraview might be wrong. If
this is the case, please file a bug report here:

Hello,

You have right the cut sphere is build but there is a problem with the
range.
For example I have a torus with Radius min = 0.006 and radius max =0.01
I build a cut sphere with a radius = 0.006
I define offset value about 7e-5 to have a cut at radius = 0.01
Why? for me with this offset the radius of the second cut would be 0.00607
and not 0.01.
Have you an explanation about this ?

Thanks for your help.

Further to my earlier questions...

I have a filter with 2 inputs. Both are allowed to be vtkDataSet type. 
(I'm using 2 input ports, rather than a single port with multiple inputs)

If I select dataset A, then create my filter, it allows me to place 
dataset A on both inputs, but dataset B won't appear in the pop-up 
menu's. If I select Dataset B, then create the filter, dataset B can be 
put on both inputs, but not dataset A.

I suspect that in the code which checks which type is permitted as an 
input, their must be some kind of bug in the logic and index 0 or 1 is 
not being correctly checked.

Whereabouts in the Paraview Code should I look to try to fix this (or at 
least understand what's going on).

thanks

JB

(NB, Paraview also core dumps if you try to create a filter with none of 
the permissible input types in existence - by which I mean, suppose 
input 1 is vtkDataSet, but input 2 must be polydata - if you instantiate 
the filter when no vtkPolydata datasets exist, Paraview core dumps - 
though it allows the creation because the presence of a vtkDataSet type 
obviously fools it into thinking that it's allowed).

Message-ID: <4208E917.9090507@gmx.de>

Hello

I started as described in the "The Paraview Guide" book chapter 18.2 to 
have a button,
where something happens if pressed.
In this case a vtkSphere will be added to the RenderWindow.

The code example:

void vtkPVRenderView::PrintColor()
{
   this->PrintColorButton->SetLabel("it works");
   vtkRenderWindow *renWindow = this->GetRenderWindow();
   vtkRenderer *ren = renWindow->GetRenderers()->GetFirstRenderer();
   renWindow->AddRenderer(ren);
   double array[3];
   array[0] = 3.0;
   array[1] = 2.0;
   array[2] = 4.0;
   vtkSphereSource *vtksphere = vtkSphereSource::New();
   vtksphere->SetCenter(array);
   vtksphere->SetRadius(sphere->getRadius() );
   vtkPolyDataMapper *sphereMapper = vtkPolyDataMapper::New();
   sphereMapper->SetInput(vtksphere->GetOutput());
   vtkActor *sphereActor = vtkActor::New();
   sphereActor->SetMapper(sphereMapper);
   ren->AddActor(sphereActor);
   renWindow->Render();

*   
((vtkPVWindow*)this->ParentWindow)->GetMainView()->GetSplitFrame()->UnpackSiblings();
   ((vtkPVWindow*)this->ParentWindow)->Script("pack %s -side top -fill 
both -expand t",
   
((vtkPVWindow*)this->ParentWindow)->GetMainView()->GetSplitFrame()->GetWidgetName());
   if (!((vtkPVWindow*)this->ParentWindow)->GetCurrentPVSource())   
{      return;   }
   ((vtkPVWindow*)this->ParentWindow)->GetCurrentPVSource()->Pack();*
}

ok so far it works - I can press the button and see in the RenderWindow 
the Sphere ;-)
The last bold lines - switch the view to the "Selection Window".
How can I bring now the Sphere in this PrintColor() function to this 
"SelectionWindow" as when I press
in the "Source" menu the Sphere item?
There are any code examples available ?

Best regards
Sebastian

The Tcl scripting language is documented here:

http://www.tcl.tk

The ParaView session files are basically scripts that drive C++ classes 
that have been wrapped into Tcl.  Only a minimal part of ParaView's 
classes needed to drive the GUI has been wrapped.  It is not really 
meant to be an easy-to-use language right now.  The only "programs" 
written by hand are for running the tests when it it built.  As far as 
the command list, you'll have to refer to the documentation of the 
classes that can be driven through Tcl, like this one:

http://www.paraview.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkPVSource.html

All those variables like $kw(vtkTemp4) are just a simple means to 
produce unique object names when dumping sessions.  If you write your 
own files they can be replaced with more descriptive Tcl variable names.

Changes in 1.8.4

- Changed the codec for AVI writing again. This time to video1 which
everyone should have.
- Some fixes to the EnSight readers
- BUG: (bug #1508) In the CopySelections method of vtkDataArraySelection,
check whether the array names and settings of the input
vtkDataArraySelection match this one before actually copying.  Without this
change, the EnSight reader was being modified when nothing had actually
changed, and so it was re-executing unnecessarily.

Hey,

the following sequence of filters works when using paraview in single mode,
but fails in parallel mode
Wavelet0
Calculator (to rename the Attribute)
Wavelet1
Group Parts (Calculator, Wavelet1)
Append Attributes

The message is:
/export/home/hpc026/paraview-1.8.2/VTK/Filtering/vtkDataSet.cxx (386)
 Point array RTData with 1 components, has 9261 tuples but there are only
3024 points

Is this a bug or is there a reason why this doesn't work?

Background: I have two files (with one data array each) and want to merge
the two data arrays, so I can calculate an isoplane of the one colored with
the second. Is there an easier way to do that?

This is probably a bug.  Please report it here:

Zein,

Paraview loads MetaImages both from .mha and .mhd files


.mha are expected to have the header and binary data together
in the same file.


.mhd and .raw are header and raw data respectively and it is
required that the .raw file will be in the same directory as
the .mhd file.



     Regards,


        Luis

Subject: [Paraview] "Inner boundary" with Reflection Filter
Message-ID: <ridmzu7pgnt.fsf@gcdw42.cdratfd.unileoben.ac.at>


I'm trying to visualize data from a simulation of a symmetrical
system. The simulation was only done for one half of the system, but
in order to ease the understanding I want to show the complete
system. 

In order this achieve this I import the data and pipe it trough the
reflection filter (with copying of the input enabled). All further
operations are done with the output of that filter.

Must of the things work OK, but I also want to show a part of the
surface of the simulation data. I apply "Extract Surface" to the
output of the reflection filter and the use "Clip" to cut away the
parts, that are not of interest.

The problem is, that now the reflection plane in the middle of the
model is visible (which is not wanted) and I have no easy way to clip
it away.

The problem seems to be, that Paraview/VTK treats the original data
and the reflection as two seperate entities.

I tried the "Clean To Grid" filter (amongst others) to solve that
problem. Now the "Connectivity" filter says that there is only one
region, but when I extract the surface from that filter the symmetry
plane is still visible.

Am I trying to do something, that ParaView can't do, or is there way
to do it?

Hello!

I noticed the "-b"/"--batch" command option (for .pvb files) is not

I can't find information about this. That I know of, there is no manual

I would really appreciate any help. Thank you in advance,

This option has been replaced by a separate "pvbatch" executable that 
you can use to run the batch scripts.  The idea is that this executable 
does not need to link to all the same GUI libraries that the main 
paraview executable must.

If you follow the "Documentation" link from www.paraview.org you will 
find a book "ParaView Guide" that is written for version 1.8.

Hi Pedro,

There is no on-line manual for version 1.8 of ParaView because that 
information is now contained in the book, "The ParaView Guide".  In your 
distribution of ParaView 1.8, there should be an executable called pvbatch 
(in the same directory as the paraview executable).  Running ParaView in 
batch  mode using the pvbatch executable is discussed on pages 78 and 79 in 
"The ParaView Guide" (available from Amazon and Kitware's on-line 
store).  Just pass the file name of the batch script as a command-line 
argument to pvbatch.  For example:

pvbatch "/Path/to/Batch/Script/batchScript.pvb"

Probably not. Since you don't want to download several Gigs of data you 
should generate it. For my first tests the wavelet source (under Source 
menu in paraview) was good enough. To recommend further sources you 
should say which features you're intrested in.

Hello,

I am trying to display the velocities in a fluid flow. I would like

Does this capability already exist? If not, what is the best approach

Hi,

After visualizing my first data with paraview I wonder, if

If so, what are the advantages of paraview compared to

Maybe, you still use both. For which tasks do you use
paraview and when opendx?

By the way, my first impression of paraview is pretty good

I am trying to load a large piece of data using the XML format. The

structured grid representation.

The text component from the  .vts file is below. The string of 
???????? represents the binary data I have excluded. I have attached a 
file with the same data and the error messages returned by Paraview.

I am assuming that 2D data is written out as three components with the 
z extents the same. Is that correct?

Dear Nancy,

I'm not an expert in Paraview but I've already compiled Paraview in a
quad-Itanium-2/Red Hat Linux advanced server without any problem. It's very
easy and you may find the source files for Paraview and Cmake from the
Kitware website (http://www.kitware.com/). You'll need Cmake to setup the
Paraview's makefiles but it will be easy if you follow the instructions
(file Compiling.html in Paraview's source directory).

What command-line arguments are you using?  If you typed an incorrect 
command-line argument, this would cause ParaView to exit.  On linux, a list 
of command-line arguments would be printed if you entered one not accepted 
by your ParaView executable, but cygwin doesn't allow you to see this 
list.  From the cygwin window, you can bring up an rxvt window (rxvt& from 
the cygwin prompt), launch your favorite shell (bash, csh, etc.), and run 
ParaView from the new window.  Then you should be able to see any messages 
that were being printed that were not visible from the cygwin window.

Subject: [Paraview] OSF1 or Tru64?
Message-ID: <DC2EA2CC6A5EF56B04BB561B@harpo.psc.edu>

CMake (and therefore ParaView) can set CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME to OSF/1 or Tru64, 
in addition to other values.

Some packages use "OSF/1" to refer to OSF/1 v2.x and v3.x, "Digital Unix" 
to refer to OSF/1 v4.x, and Tru64 to refer to v5.x. What is the correct 
mapping for CMake?

"uname" says our system is OSF/1 v5.1 (and so that's what ParaView thinks) 
but perhaps I should force it to think it is Tru64.

Thanks!

Do you need an IF based on the CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME?   For the cmake/vtk

CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME == "OSF1"

Seems to work, so my question is why would you change it?

I assume CMake has some "if" statements based on that variable.

Because ParaView will not compile on our system. We spent about a week 
getting ParaView 1.6.3 to work using a lot of hand editing.

The main problem is that CMake doesn't get the size of various variables 
right. It is also unable to decide between various overloaded functions in 
some places. Its not really a CMake problem - its just that our system may 
be a bit unusual. I hope to find a way to nudge CMake in the right 
direction.

CMake is supposed to work on many (even obscure) platforms.  If it isn't 
getting things right please report the details of the problems so we can 
fix it for the future.  Either the ParaView CMake code or CMake itself 
may need a fix.

A common reason for getting the sizes wrong is if you change the 
compiler or flags setting after CMake has configured the first time.  If 
you want to create a new build tree for ParaView with some special C or 
C++ flags then do this:

export CC="cc"
export CXX="CC"
export CFLAGS="-enable64"
export CXXFLAGS="-enable64"
cmake ../ParaView

where you fill in the appropriate compiler and flag names.  This way 
CMake will use the proper flags for the configuration step.  We are 
working on getting CMake to deal with changing the compiler after the 
first configuration phase but it isn't implemented yet.

Well, if it is not tested, it usually does not work.  There is not OSF dashboard
for ParaView. We have one for VTK and CMake, so they should work for you.
Both gnu and the native compilers are tested.   If you would be willing to dontate
a dashboard, I am sure we can get it working and keep it working for you.

But there are dashboards for OSF1. They can be found in the Experimental section at the kitware paraview site. Build parameters are there too.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 1.8.4 commandline arguments
Message-ID: <a6bc6cc050223073540d2c1f5@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to get Paraview 1.8.4 to run in parallel mode. I use the
following commands:

Server:
mpirun -np 4 /usr/local/common/paraview-1.8.4-linux/bin/paraview 
--server --port=10000

Client:
paraview --client --host=node2 --port=10000

When I execute the server command, Paraview starts a client on node2
of my Beowulf cluster. I do not see any indication that Paraview is
running on any of my other nodes.

When I try to connect with the client, I get a connection refused error.

If I use Paraview 1.8.2, the program starts up in server mode on 4
nodes and I am able to connect with the client.

I looked at the commandline arguments for 1.8.4 and it seems nothing
has changed from 1.8.2.

Does anyone have any advice or comments on how to resolve this
problem? Thank you.

ParaView 1.8.5 is now available from www.paraview.org  changes in 1.8.5
include:

- A number of further improvements to the EnSight readers
- A fix in the MPI communicator for MPI versions that have MPI_LONG_LONG_INT
but not MPI_LONG_LONG

Changes in 1.8.4 include

- Changed the codec for AVI writing again. This time to video1 which
everyone should have.
- Some fixes to the EnSight readers
- BUG: (bug #1508) In the CopySelections method of vtkDataArraySelection,
check whether the array names and settings of the input
vtkDataArraySelection match this one before actually copying.  Without this
change, the EnSight reader was being modified when nothing had actually
changed, and so it was re-executing unnecessarily.

Subject: [Paraview] writeing vts files
Message-ID: <421CF339.8030803@as.arizona.edu>

Hello,

I would like to plea for assistance in understanding what is wrong 
with the .vts format of the file I am trying to load into paraview. 
The file is included below  with truncated data. The entire file is 
attached.

I have examined the length of the appended data record and it is 
34136, the correct length to encode one floating scalar and a three 
component float vector (dimensions 40X20X2). The output I receive from 
Paraview consists of 3 occurrences of:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: 
/usr3/swl/packages/ParaView/VTK/IO/vtkXMLStructuredDataReader.cxx (281)
  Error reading extent 0 39 0 19 0 1 from piece 0
ErrorMessage end
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I have looked at the code, but it is not easy to read. The parse 
routines are order 4500 lines long, with mangled names and large 
#defines rather that inline functions. I does confuse my debugger. Any 
help would be appreciated.

The only example on the CD and distribution includes zlib compression. 
Is that required, or is there another string required to say "no 
compression". I cannot find any details in the books or enclosed CD. 
The terms "binary" and "base64" seem to be overlapped.

My goal is to achieve native binary encoding, with 2D rather than 3D 
inputs.

Thanks in advance for any assistance.

Message-ID: <ridr7j6b9fu.fsf@gcdw42.cdratfd.unileoben.ac.at>


I'm trying to run ParaView 1.8.5[1] on a Linux-machine.
When I start ParaView locally at the machine it works, but when I
start it over the Network (the DISPLAY is my Windows-machine with
Exceed 9.0) the Splash-Screen appears and then ParaView stops. The
only message in the Terminal is

[bgschaid@gcdw89 ~]$ paraview

  Serial number of failed request:  1086
  Current serial number in output stream:  1086
[bgschaid@gcdw89 ~]$

I'm using the precompiled binaries.

Obviously there seems to be problem with OpenGL-Acceleration. I tried
the --use-software-rendering switch, but this doesn't make any
difference. 

Is there a chance, that I can make this problem go away by recompiling
ParaView? Or is there any other way to fix this?

Do you have glx enabled? Run 'xdpyinfo' on the remote machine to find
out. It should print out the list of X extensions it supports and one of
them should be glx.

Hi Bernhard,

I have had a similar problem. The solution is to enable GLX support in
Exceed.

You need "Exceed 3D" (I think there are "3D" and "non-3D" version of Exceed)
:
- right-click on Exceed taskbar button
- Select "Tools..." > "Configure..."
- then select "Protocols..." (the handshake icon)
- then click on the button "Extensions..."
- Check both "GLX" checkboxes
- OK -> OK -> OK
- open your remote session and try

I am using Exceed 3D 7.1, so the menu entries might be a bit different

Regards,

-- Julien

Hi Julien!

Thanks for your quick response.

I'm afraid it doesn't solve my problem: I didn't say it in my original
mail, but GLX was already enabled (I have Exceed3D installed; checking
with xdpyinfo says that GLX is working)[1]. In fact, other applications
that use GLX work fine.

At least now I know, that previous versions of Exceed worked with
ParaView. 

regards
Bernhard

The CVS version of these readers is currently undergoing some changes so 
this may be a bogus message, though it looks like a reasonable error if 
something is wrong with your appended data section.

To what source files are you referring?

If you leave off the "compressor" attribute from the top-level VTKData 
element then there is no compression.

The "binary" format means that the data are inlined inside the DataArray 
element.  Inlined data must be base64 encoded to keep the XML valid. 
The "appended" format means that the data are in the AppendedData 
element at the end of the file.  This element has its own "encoding" 
attribute which is usually base64.  As a hack to support fast reading we 
also allow the AppendedData section to be pure binary (not encoded), 
though this makes the document invalid XML.

Jeremy,

Hmmm.... Don't know about 1.8.4 but in the trunk there's now a whole
sequence of new executables. pvclient, pvserver, etc... and also the

Subject: [Paraview] Compilation problem with Paraview 1.8.5...
Message-ID: <20050224193947.2FC413411A@public.kitware.com>

 
Hi all,

I've been getting some problems when trying to compile Paraview v.1.8.5 in a
Intel Itanium-2 system with Red Hat Linux Advanced server. I followed the
steps described in the compiling.html file but when I try to run the make
command I get the following error message:

--------------------------------------------
Building dependencies. cmake.depends...
-- Using Buildname: Linux-c++
cmake.depends is up-to-date

-------------------------------------------

I suppose the problem is with the shell scripts inside the Utilities/TclTK
directory because after I have changed the files with those provided in a
previous version of Paraview (1.8.3) I got success withou any problem.

Thanks in advance

Renato N. Elias

P.S: I'm using cmake cmake release 2.0.3 for ia64/linux systems.

Subject: [Paraview] create Animation from .pvd files
Message-ID: <421F2F90.2060908@temf.tu-darmstadt.de>

Hello!

I use .pvd files to load different parts of a vectorfield from a 
distributed simulation into ParaView. When I try to create an animation 
using those files ("Action: Filename" in the animation section), 
ParaView seems to load and display only the first part of the data 
listed in the pvd file. For example: If I create .pvd files named 
"a_field-{timestepnumber}.pvd", which contains

<VTKFile type="Collection">
<Collection>
<DataSet part="0" file="a_field-part0-{timestepnumber}.vtr"/>
<DataSet part="1" file="a_field-part1-{timestepnumber}.vtr"/>
</Collection>
</VTKFile>

then ParaView creates an animation using only the data from 
a_field-part0-{timestepnumber}.vtr. The data from 
a_field-part1-{timestepnumber}.vtr is displayed but does not change 
during the animation. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks in advance

	Hi Stephen

	Binary vtk files is okay with paraview

	For the first part I am in the same case, I guess it is possible to
avoid the duplication of the mesh components in a 	time simulation but
i can't figure out how to do...

	Each of my paraview file is about 40 Mo and I want to animate about
900 time steps with 3 scalars,  saving the storage of the mesh would be
great in my case also ( maybe via scripts ? )

Hi,

The reader is not included with the ParaView builds from www.paraview.org.
You'll need to get a build from Sandia.  If you have access to the Sandia
IRN you can go to http://www.ran.sandia.gov/paraview/ .  Otherwise, I'd send
a request to paraview-help@sandia.gov

Some big animation changes were made recently in the CVS version of 
ParaView.  If you were using a CVS version you can try upgrading to the 
latest CVS version to see if the changes fix your problem.  If it still 
persists, please report it as a bug here:

Brad,

Sorry for the delay in getting back. I answer to the questions you posed:

The source files are from the CVS download.

1) The one that is 4622 lines long is xmlparse.c.

2) There are many defines in the xmlparse.c code, but there is an 
entire file called vtl_expat_mangle.h that redefines function names. 
This is probably required to accommodate C++ overloading, but it makes 
debugging difficult. The debugger tracks compiler mangled names 
without any confusion.

3) xmltok_impl.c and vtkSetGet.h are examples of where I thought 
inlined functions might be more appropriate than the #defines which 
are not expanded by the debugger.

I would like to find documentation on how to add, or extend, a file 
reader so that frame sequences contained in one file could be viewed 
as an animation. I would also appreciate documentation on the logical 
flow of operations, like thinking in the POP world. I need to make my 
own arrow glyph where only the length of the shaft is scaled a 
function of the vector magnitude.

The numerous documents I purchased from Kitware describe visualization 
of petabyte data sets as a goal for Paraview. My goals are large, but 
a couple of orders of magnitude less ambitious. An efficient approach 
appears to employ the use of memory mapped image files in a 64-bit 
environment. My current machine had 16GB of ram, and could be extended 
to 32GB. Then the fabrication of IO data sets would not be a concern 
to the user. He would just make a huge HDF5 structure and the system 
would access the set of components directed by him. Is this type of 
approach consistent with your broad objectives?

Thanks for your time
don

I'd say the best approach is to write an HDF5 reader that understands
time, can provide information about what time steps are available and
allows the user to set the time step(s) to load. It can also do smart
things, such as not duplicating the geometry if it stays same over
time. Once such a reader exists, it would be very easy to incorporate
it into ParaView. There is already a simple HDF5 reader in ParaVIew.
This can be used as a starting point.

Files in directories like VTK/Utilities/vtkexpat and Utilities/vtktiff 
are external libraries that we import into VTK's source tree to reduce 
dependency and versioning issues.  The "mangle" headers make sure the 
VTK versions of the libraries do not conflict with system versions of 
the libraries and are implemented as macros to avoid making big changes 
to outside code that we might import again when a newer version is 
available.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview and vtk
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0502281621380.11497-100000@hal>

Hello,

I'm new to paraview. Just wonder why paraview keeps its own copy of vtk.  
If I download/install vtk, and want to link with the separately installed 
vtk rather than the one that comes with paraview, is there a switch in 
cmake (paraview's CMakeLists.txt) that allow me to do this?

Regards,

Weiguang
