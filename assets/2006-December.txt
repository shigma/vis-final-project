Thank you for your reply,  I think you are right, but I don't know how to 
fix it, I am running on Linux. The PV is not writting the 
"ParaViewTrace0.pvs" file, today, I can't update GUI even as a root, the PV 
erase the old trace file withou creating one. I have the writing privileges 
on the default and enough free disk.

Thanks,

Yi

Subject: [Paraview] Algorithmically what is d(vx)/dx in vtkCell.h?
Message-ID: <52360f190612011253t307250f0w2d81aa392246e001@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!
There are several numerical methods to calculate dx, dy, dz at a cell. I am
searching for the exact numerical method implemented in vtkCellDerivatives.
My dataset is rectilinear with equally spaced x,y,z. That makes the
hexahedron required to compute derivatives to be cube in my case.

What exactly is d(vx)/dx in vtkCell.h then?

Is it just the difference in value of vx across cell?
Also,

I could NOT find Derivatives function implementation in any of
vtkGenericCell.cxx, vtkCell.cxx, vtkCell3D.cxx.

My aim here is to check how exactly vorticity is calculated and verify if
that is what we want to use or write our own implementation, as the current
visualizations give some artifacts in vorticity isosurfaces which isn't
technically correct.

Thanks a ton in advance.
Aditya

Subject: [Paraview] --render-node-port
Message-ID: <45709B52.7010206@inl.gov>

Hi everyone,

I'm new to the paraview envirionment and am having problems getting some 
of my network connections working.  I am trying to specify the 
render-node-port option in my configuration file, but it doesn't appear 
to be taking hold - since the data and render servers keep trying to 
connect to another port - which is not open on our firewall.  I need to 
be able to control these port numbers so I can get them through the 
firewall. 

In my configuration file, I am specifying:
    <Option Name="render-node-port" Value="33331" />

but when the servers try and connect, I get something like 5241, and a 
different one on each run.

Where am I going wrong??

Thanks in advance for your help.

Jim

Hi Kent,

Thank you for your reply again,  I have new findings and I don't know who to 
ask so I have to ask you and the forum. Now I found out my problem is the 
GUI for data property sheet,   those selection window, 
parameters/display/infomation tab, etc. ran out of the display area from the 
top, or in another word, several hundred pixels were missing from the top, 
which only happens in the source view,  3D view and Keyframe view were ok.

Any further idea?

Thanks.

  Hello

  Is it usefull to buy the Paraview book right now or should one wait for a 
new version, encompassing Paraview III? In another words, buying the book 
now how would it hold on against the future (let's speak a 2/3 year 
prospect).

It will probably take us until summer 2007 to update the book for
ParaView 3. A lot of the concepts in the current book will be
applicable to ParaView 3. We will also provide some online
documentation with ParaView 3. A combination of the current book and
online documentation (and this mailing list) should be enough to get
started with ParaView 3.

As far as I know, this can't be done in ParaView. I think the raw
image reader can do something similar but not with the file formats
that you mentioned.

Hi Kent,

Thank you very much for your help, I changed my session from Gnome to KDE 
and everything works Ok, I guess this due to some violation in some 
configuration file some where. I didn't have time to find out what it is. 
But I will try to figure it out this week.

Mike,
A solution would be to create a stack of your BMP/TIFF/JPEG images with 
the opensource software ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) as "raw 
data" and then open it with paraview. It's very fast and quite easy.
Best Regards

Message-ID: <37646.193.49.69.213.1165340027.squirrel@espci.org>

Hi all,

I'm new to the list. I want to do volume rendering of 3D structured point
dataset with paraview 2.4.4 . here is the procedure I'm using
- open data
- tetrahedralize (for instance)
- go to 'Display' tab of the tetrahedralize result
- modify 'Representation' value to 'Volume Render'

When using this procedure with my laptop (acer 8204 wlmi, graphic circuit
ATI mobility radeon x1600) I can only view the surface of my
parallelipipedic volume (like with Representation parameter set to
'Surface' ). Meanwhile paraview is using all the processor ressources.
Does somebody already heard about such a problem ? do you heard about some
way to fix the problem. I use the same procedure on another computer, and
it was working correctly.

thanks for your help
Beno?t

Message-ID: <46163.192.168.2.29.1165407298.squirrel@webmail.cis.jhu.edu>

Greetings:

I would like to create a group of points around a volume or surface and
save that group of points. Will this be possible in the future development
of Paraview III?

In paraview 2.9.5, there is a "selection mode (s)" option. The element
inspector reports back a triangular location but cannot save this
information or generate a list of selections.

If I view a volume or surface with a collection of points, I would like
to drag the points around the image. Then, save the new positions of the
points. Would this be possible in the future?

A screen shot with example data:

   http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~akolasny/paraview3/volume_and_landmark_data.jpg
   http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~akolasny/paraview3/MoviedefAtlas0.vtk
   http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~akolasny/paraview3/BZV10.L_SC0_5v_SC1_22L_RLM.vtp

Paraview is a fantastic visualization tool. The "selection mode (s)" has
great potential to adding interactivity.

Your comments are greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Anthony

Hi,

The answer depends on whether you are using vtkImageData or
vtkStructuredGrid. For vtkImageData, look at vtkVoxel.cxx (search for
vtkVoxel::Derivatives). For vtkStructuredGrid, look at
vtkHexahedron.cxx.

Can you send me a dataset to reproduce this? It sounds like something
that should be looked at.

Hi Jim,

I'm copying your message back to the ParaView mailing list. Please keep 
the discussion there so other people can help answer your questions and 
so the discussion and any solutions are archived.

Would you also please attach a copy of the ParaView configuration file 
you are using?

No, no, much easier:
    Your Images are stored as
xxx001.jpeg
xxx002.jpeg
    and so on I suppose. So you import all the images with ImageJ as 
"ImageSequence", then you go to "Image" -> "Stacks" -> "Convert Images 
to Stack". Then you save your stack as a ".raw" file and open it with 
paraview or vtk.
    Hope that helps.

Best Regards

       Milan

Hi Amy,

Here are my configuration files.  They are pretty simple as I am just 
trying to get a configuration working before I  go parallel with 
anything.  I am trying to run the client and render server on my 
workstation, with the data server out on one of our clusters.  I have a 
firewall in the middle I am having to tunnel through, that's why all the 
host names are localhost - so they'll pick up my tunnel.

Client:
    <?xml version="1.0" ?>
    <pvx>
            <Option Name="client-render-server" />
            <Option Name="connect-render-to-data" />
            <Option Name="data-server-host" Value="localhost" />
            <Option Name="render-server-host" Value="localhost" />

            <Process type="client">
            </Process>
    </pvx>

Data Server
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>
        <Option Name="render-server-host" Value="localhost" />
        <Option Name="render-node-port" Value="33331" />

        <Process type="data-server">
                <Machine Name="localhost" />
        </Process>

</pvx>


Render Server
    <?xml version="1.0" ?>
    <pvx>
            <Process type="render-server">
                    <Machine Name="galbja" />
            </Process>
    </pvx>

Message-ID: <BAY106-F11DDDA5B13FCCF7B6DB691ACDD0@phx.gbl>

Hi,

I  try to write a custom lookup table, so during animation, I will get 
different shade(transparency) during different time step. The shades look 
ok, but the colors doesn't. For example,  I want to construct a gray scale 
lookup table, even I have different percentages of rgb components for 
different scalars, I couldn't get different shade of gray,  the gray colors 
are the same everywhere. Any idea?

Thanks,

Yi

Hi,

 I have made some changes on Paraview and now I would like to make
a tarball such that I can install my version of Paraview on other

to make the kind of binary tarball we can download from the web site

TIA,

Hi Olivier,

Try doing a "make install"; ParaView will install to the directory 
listed in the CMake variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. Then you can make a 
tarball of the directory where you did the install.

Subject: [Paraview] new features for the calculator
Message-ID: <20061208130109.GK28388@localhost.localdomain>


Sorry, it's a wish, not an announcement :)

I had to compute some values on streamline so I used the Calculator
tool. It's a wonderful tool but missing some features I needed :

 - a d/dx, d/dy and d/dz operator
 - a max and min operators
 - a coordinate, (x,y,z), field (which exists in Paraview III :)  

To do my computation I hacked the vtkStreamTracer.cxx to add the
fields I needed (dP/dx, dU/dx, dU/dy). But I'm sure it is not the
best way to do.

                                             Olivier.

Hi Olivier,

in addition to Amy's answer, please note that newer Versions of CMake come with CPack, which may help you to generate a binary tarball directly from your build tree. See http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:Packaging_With_CPack
for details.

Subject: [Paraview] multiple execution of Image Reader when running PV in
	parallel
In-Reply-To: <20061208112305.GJ28388@localhost.localdomain>
References: <20061208112305.GJ28388@localhost.localdomain>
Message-ID: <457D3AD0.9000006@cscs.ch>

I am having trouble developping a custom reader (public inheritance of
vtkImageAlgorithm). When running PV on a single node, my reader executes
once only - as expected - and creates a vtkImageData. I can then use any
number of Filters downstream

When running PV on multiple nodes, my reader executes every time I start
a new filter. Can't figure out what triggers it.

Forget about my own source code. I went back to the basics and put a
DebugOn() statement in vtkImageReader. It exhibits exactly the same
behavior:

on a single node, execute once and only once as expected.
on multiple nodes, executes multiple times. Here is an example running
on 2 nodes,

First read of a 90^3 raw binary file (the extents are split in the Z
direction):

Reading extent: 0, 89, 0, 89, 0, 45
Reading extent: 0, 89, 0, 89, 43, 89

then I extracted a I=29 ortho-slice and the reader executed again

Reading extent: 29, 29, 0, 89, 0, 89
Reading extent: 29, 29, 0, 89, 0, 89

then I extracted an J=45 orthoslice and the reader executed again
Reading extent: 0, 89, 45, 45, 0, 89
Reading extent: 0, 89, 45, 45, 0, 89

then I executed an isosurface and the reader executed again

Reading extent: 0, 89, 0, 89, 0, 45
Reading extent: 0, 89, 0, 89, 43, 89

We have only found this multiple execution with ImageData. Other readers
(for example for StructuredGrid) do not execute multiple times.

is this a feature reserved to ImageData?

thanks for any tip on this issue.

Hi Folks,

I posted the December snapshot of ParaView III. The download links and
announcemets for all snapshots cam be found at:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_snapshots

This snapshot includes binaries for Windows, Linux (32 and 64 bit) and
Mac OS X. The source can be obtained through CVS.

Here are some the things we have been working on:

* Reading multiple exodus files.
* Many property panel improvements and fixes.
* File dialog fixes.
* Improved chart code.
* Improved testing framework, which now includes python.
*  Improved pipeline browser.
*  Play/Pause in VCR controls.
*  Light Kit controls added.
*  Auto generated and custom panel improvements.
*  More robust server connection, w/ feedback.
*  File dialog improvements.

There is still very little documentation. Look at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III to get more information on the new
features. We will continue adding more documentation to this page as
we progress. We will also start working on online documentation in
January.

Good to see the progress. What is involved in getting my own custom  
modules to compile into ParaView III? I Only used XML for the UI and  
such. I did not do any hacking in the ParaView tree at all?

Hi the list,

Having 2.9.5 release, is it possible to update the cvs tree, or should I
download the full cvs tree for the
december release ?

(updating, ie "cvs update", does not seem to download the complete cvs
tree. May I doing something wrong ?)


Cheers,

If you have a 2.9.5 revision of the code from CVS, you can do
"cvs update -Pd -r ParaView-2-9-December"
to change your 2.9.5 code to 2.9.6.

Is there any way to color by Vertex location?

In my specific case I have an almost-planar dataset with slight fluctuations
in the Z dimension.  I need to map a color to this 3rd dimension to show the
high points & low points.

The easiest way to do that is to use the elevation filter to generate an
array that gives the relative Z location.

Hi Randall,

can not the Elevation filter solve it for you?

Ok, that's one way... Don't know why I didn't think of that... doh!

Is there any "simpler" method?  I was hoping for a literal "Map Color to Z"
way, probably via the Array Calculator or something..  But at least this is
an option.

ParaView 2.6 will have the ability to access coordinates in the array
calculator.  That's another way to do the same thing.  It's not any
easier to set up, but at least the values in the scalar bar will be
right.

HI,
   Is there any chance that access to the current time step index could 
be added into the array calculator? I realize that the actual simulation 
time is more complicated, but the current time step index would take 
care of my needs. To be clear, what I mean is I load a series of binary 
old style vtk files 0001.vtk through nnnn.vtk. When I animate through 
them to make a movie I would like to have access in the calculator to 
the Timestep integer that is shown in the vtkPDataSetReader parameters tab.

Randall;

You can always add to the point data set the value (Z - Zreference).

We are working on designing a more comprehensive plugin architecture.
It will definitely involve writing a server manager XML description.
The GUI XML is going away.

Thanks for the report. This sounds like a bug in the installation
script. I guess you are the first person to run ParaView III on a ppc
Mac (other than me that is) :) For now, I recommend building from
source. I will try to look into this next month. Unless (!), there is
volunteer out there that is willing to debug the script that creates
the bundle. In that case, I will be happy to provide any help I can.

Are you saying that there is a script that creates the application  
bundle with all the RPATHS set correctly for OS X? I'd be happy to  
start digging through that to see what I can offer.. I have been  
waiting for this for a loooooong time..

BTW.. the Intel build of ParaView III is correct. It works fine and  
all the libraries have all the RPATHS set correctly..

vtkCellDerivatives does this. If I find the time, I will enable this
in the ParaView 2.6 filter menu.

This would be  a good addition.

Andy Cedilnik added this to ParaView 2.6.

We have some long term plans to overhaul the array calculator. We are
also adding support to add python based custom filters to ParaView 3.

Yup. Andy wrote it. It is
ParaView3/Applications/Client/CreateBundle.sh.in.  It gets configured
into the build tree as CreateaBundle.sh under the same location.
Eventually, it will become a cmake script.

I know. I test the intel build on my machine at home. I don't test the
ppc build on anything other than the one I build on. When running the
script, I see warning but I assumed that it was still working. Looking
at the output of otool -L paraview, everything looks normal. I can
also run it without problems on that machine. Looking at the error, it
looks like assistant's paths are not being modified correctly.  otool
-L on assistant shows wrong paths whereas on intel, they are fine.

Finally I'm able to render a tile from the ray cast mapper in my vtk
application.
I have two questions for you:

1 - When I render a tile with IceT, it casts ray only from that
selected pixels, or it computes all the image then clips?
I think the first, infact I captured the last render time and it's
faster when I only render a tile instead of all the image...

2 - When I don't set tile dimensions and I leave the default mode, it
composes only a single tile, the entire image... that image is
rendered in cooperation by all the processes or only by the process 0?
that is, I had parallel volume rendering or not? I wasn't able to
prove that because I don't have a cluster or a parallel machine, but I
simulate it in my desktop pc with MPI....

Thank you in advance

It's not easy to answer that question.  IceT will always render images
the size of the tiles (sort of).  So if each tile is 1024x768, IceT will
always render 786K pixels at a time.  If necessary, IceT will perform
multiple renderings to get all the pixels.  This is often done on a
tile-by-tile basis, which would be the first case you mentioned.
However, IceT also tries to minimize the number of renders it invokes,
so it sometimes "floats" the viewport away from any tile.  In this
particular case, the rendering will have more pixels covered by the
geometry.  In situations such as yours where the rendering is fragment
processing bound, this increases the time for each rendering, but
reduces the overall rendering time.

Again this is difficult to answer because ParaView changes its behavior
to give the best performance in a variety of situations.  Assuming that
you are running in client/server mode AND compositing is on AND the size
of your geometry is above the composite threshold, then yes, parallel
volume rendering should be happening.

Subject: [Paraview] ctest/Paraview dashboard testing/fail
Message-ID: <458257E5.9020308@cscs.ch>

I'd like to run a full set of tests before committing some changes, 
but when using mpich2 on win32, ctest always fails all of the MPI tests
an example is as follows

pvTestDriver: server command is:
 "C:/Program Files/MPICH2/bin/mpiexec.exe" "-localonly -np" "2" "D:/cmakebuild/paraview/bin/RelWithDebInfo/pvserver"
pvTestDriver: client command is:
 "C:/Program Files/MPICH2/bin/mpiexec.exe" "-localonly -np" "1" "D:/cmakebuild/paraview/bin/RelWithDebInfo/pvclient" "--disable-registry" "D:/Code2/ParaView/GUI/Testing/Tcl/ExtractGrid.pvs" "-D" "D:/Code2/ParaView/Data" "-C" "D:/Code2/ParaView/GUI/Testing/Tcl/CompareImages.tcl" "-T" "D:/cmakebuild/paraview/Testing/Temporary" "-V" "D:/Code2/ParaView/Data/Baseline/ExtractGrid.png"
pvTestDriver: starting process server


If the quotation marks are removed (around "-localonly -np" "2"), then the commands 
execute as per expected. Has anyone else had this problem and solved it. 
I shall perhaps create some batch file which cleans the command line and passes 
it through, but it seems like a lot of work...

Subject: [Paraview] Bug with timesteps
Message-ID: <20061215112120.304170@gmx.net>

Hello, 

I just started using paraview 2.4.4 (the Linux x86 binary) and 
noticed the following bug:
Loading a series of 45 AVS/UCD files, the data shown at timestep 
(counting from 0) 15 is that of timestep 14 again, and 30 is that 
of 29.
The problems occurs when paraview automatically loads in the 
series, as well as when the files are added manually to make 
up the series.

Can somebody reproduce this and is there a fix for it?

Regards,
Stefan

Hi,
For those of you who want to show a time stamp during your animation, there 
is a simple way to do it, you load your animation data through paraview, 
make the corner text as visible, then save session state, you get a file end 
with 'pvs', open this file, search for the string 'SetAnimationtime',  you 
probably  will see '$kw(vtkTemp661) SetAnimationTime $num', in any of the 
SetCornerText, you can add something like 'Time = [$kw(vtkTemp661) 
GetAnimationTime]', if you want to do some fancy thing about your time 
stamp, you can  even assign a procedure to the 'Time'.

Is there any way to export an image in eps or pdf format? I desperately

If this can be done just by adding some C++ codes to Paraview, can you

I have a reader for an AMR data format based on HDF5. The data creation
is integrated in my co-workers' AMRCART code (
http://www.astro.phys.ethz.ch/staff/folini/private/research/a_maze/a_maze.html
). If you can produce data with our HDF5 convention, I would be happy to
share my reader source code.

Does anyone know if it's possible to save the transient results of the
Integrate Attributes data. I'm trying to probe the height of water in a
finite element volume-of-fluid free surface run. For this purpose a
intersect two cutting planes which produces a line placed at the point I'm
measuring the water weight. After that I use the clip filter to clip the
data between the values greater than 0.5 and less than 1 (who works with
volume of fluid will know what I'm talking about) and use the Integrate
Attributes filter to give me the length of this clipped line (the height of
water). The problem is that I have a bunch of time steps to measure and it's
too boring and unproductive to pick the values one-by-one. Does anyone have
any better idea?

I thought about the idea that David DeMarle gave me of using a pvbatch
script but I don't know how to access the Integrate Attributes data from a
script.

Thanks for any help

Renato.

P.s.: Some time ago I posted a message talking about a probe tool able to do
that. The basic idea is that the probing point should travel anchored in a
specific value probing the coordinates of the path travelled. I haven't
found any visualization tool able to do that yet.

Hi,
Has anyone developed or is anyone developing an ADCIRC reader for
ParaView?  I'm considering writing one, but I wouldn't want to duplicate
effort.  A quick Googling didn't reveal anything, so I thought I'd ask
before I jumped in with both feet.

Thanks,
Sean

I have code written in a VTK function sorta way (vtkDataSet *LoadADCIRC(info
struct)) that's integrated into ezViz.  It's far from a full-fledged reader
class, but should be hard to expand into one if you want to take a crack at
it.

That's closer to ParaView than what I have, which reads the data for a
custom application.  I'd be glad to take a crack at it.

Thanks,

Hi Renato,

I have used the Integrate Attributes filter with transient datasets and
I did the following to save the integrated values across timesteps.
- load the transient data
- integrate the value you need for the first time step (I think you need
to enable Show XYPlot in the Integrate Attributes filter)
- click Play animation button (watch the XYplot update!)
- click SaveAsCVS button in the Integrate Attributes filter at the end
of the animation

This should give the list of the integrated values for all the
timesteps. For information, I modified the filter and related classes to
save transient data in .dat format which I found more convenient for my
usage rather than .cvs.

Cheers,
Theophane

Hi Theophane,

Thanks for your hint. I tried to do what you said but the "integrate
attributes" does not have the XY Plot, at least in ParaView 2.2.1 which is
the version that I'm still using. I'm forced to keep using this version
because, for me, this is the best version for whom works with Ensight files.
BTW, I've just checked the PV 2.4.4 version and the "integrate attributes"
filter in this version actually has the XY-Plot. Unfortunately, I can't use
this version because the "append datasets" and "clean to grid" filters don't
work with my Ensight files (I have to load several pieces of model and
"glue" these parts because my ran was done in parallel). 

I know that most of these annoyances are due to the limitations of PV with
Ensight's format but I'd really like to keep using Ensight's format. The VTK
formats are a bit strange to program and use in Fortran (I even can't
understand the VTK format structure). It would be good to have a tool to
translate these datasets between some formats or some import/export
capability in PV. I started to do a VTK/TCL script to translate files
between Ensight and VTK format but I gave up after discovered that VTK
formats do not have an easy way to implement transient data sets as
Ensight's format has.

Anyway, thank's for your help. I'll keep struggling with my Ensight's files
;o)

What were the problems you had with ensight files? I had trouble because 
the particles were stored using 1 offset, but the ensight reader creates 
them using zero offset - this causes bad coordinates and dodgy output. I 
have a fix for this that I still haven't checked in. If this is your 
problem, please say and I'll check it in.

Hi Jb

No, in fact my problem with Ensight's files are due to some specific filters
such as the "append datasets" and "clean to grid". Some time ago Berk
explained that the Ensight's readers were being redesigned and that there
would be some features not working properly until these implementation
issues completely solved. The last PV version, I'd say, with "maximum
support" to Ensight's file is the 2.2.1. The newer versions only have basic
support such as reading the files and ploting basic things.

Renato.

ps: If I'm saying something wrong regarding this subject (Ensight's files
and PV) or something has changed, please, update me.

I finally was able to take a look at that script... Wouldn't this be

Try updating to the ParaView-2-6 branch. We are no longer maintaining
the CVS head.

Hi Folks,

I just wanted to let those of you that are adventurous enough to work
from ParaView CVS that the CVS head is no longer being maintained.
Make sure that you update your ParaView checkout to ParaView-2-6
branch with

cvs update -r ParaView-2-6 -dP

The ParaView 3 CVS tree is taking over ParaView CVS. The instructions
for checking that out is here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_snapshots

As we make progress, we will update the ParaView web pages to reflect
this change.

I noticed that Save Session State correctly saves the Orientation Axes
Visibility and Corner Annotation whereas Save Batch Script does not save
this information.

Is this lack of features known by the developpers? Can it be fixed for
the 2.6 release?

I use the 2.6 branch of ParaView.

This CVS version of ParaView crashes when attempting to use the pick
filter on the IronProt.vtk data set.
I am running the pvserver with the off-screen rendering flag on IRIX64
6.5.30f (MIPSpro.7313) and the pvclient on Linux (x86_64).

Note building paraview on IRIX64 required that I patch several files.
Over the past year, building on Irix has become more difficult (I find
myself unrolling changes back to previous versions of ParaView).

Has anyone else encounter this problem yet? 

Thanks,

Jose

I use a light background, so labels for tetrahedron and reader outline box

Should it be possible/envisageable to let the user choose the colors ?

Thanks in advance.

Randall,
 
Hmmm..... I'm pretty sure plain old Mesa will work. I think the popping
up of the X window was fixed a while back.
 
I'm poking through the archives and cannot find the confirmation of
this... but we have dozens of clusters without graphics cards running
Mesa pvservers (all servers are running X though...).  
 
Now if the servers don't have X, then I'm not sure about this... maybe
someone who know a bit more about it can chime in?

	Well.. Correct me if I'm wrong (/crossfingers hoping i'm wrong)
but I'm trying to get VTk running on systems with no video displays, no
hardware acceleration, and no running x-server.  From what I've
experienced in the past (albeit all this testing was back in the 4.4
days), the only way to get that was with Mangled Mesa.  Mesa would get
visualizations working without hardware acceleration, but still insisted
on popping up windows (if you had X running) to do so.
	
	If I could get my visualizations working (which are all
single-frame, render to PNG type stuff) without mangled mesa I'ld be
happy.  But, in my experience, there's no way to get it working in all
three cases in a completely "invisible" (meaning no visible display)
way. 
	  1) Workstation with GPU card & X running, and you're on the
display
	  2) Remote system with no GPU card and X not running
	  3) Remote system with GPU & X, but you don't own the display
(connecting in remotely via ssh)

			I've been using MangledMesa with VTK (5.0.1) for
quite a while now with pretty good success, but I ran into an issue
where I couldn't get vtkTextActor's to display in the resulting displays
at all.
			
			So I upgraded to a newer VTK hoping this was
fixed (Paraview-2-6 branch) and recompiled everything.  Now my resulting
renderings are completely blank.  I did have some issues with getting it
to compile as it seems a few of the files in the Rendering directory
have desynced between the vtkMesa* and vtkOpenGL* versions.  I manually
resynced them (Just had to copy some function definitions in the .h
files over) and it compiled. 
			
			So my question is a 2 parter:
			1) Anyone know how to get TextActors to work
with the 5.0.1 VTK?  Was there a known bug around that time that's been
fixed, or is there some new option that must be enabled to get it to
work? 
			2) How to I get MangledMEsa to work in the newer
VTK releases?  Right now i'm getting either blank or random-garbage
displays.

It should be possible to do off-screen rendering with straight Mesa and
OSMesa, though I'm not sure if VTK is easily configured to do so
(haven't tried it).  Perhaps this how Sandia is doing it without Mangled
Mesa?

AFAIK, the purpose of Mangled Mesa is to avoid having to reconfigure
your system.  Mangled Mesa renames (mangles) all the function calls to
insure the OpenGL calls go to Mesa and not the system-installed
libGL.so.  Also, in VTK, when you turn on Mangled Mesa, it automatically
switches to OSMesa to do the off-screen rendering without X.

I would think straight Mesa + OSMesa would be a cleaner approach, and it
wouldn't require running xvfb every time either.

Message-ID: <22c30b9e0612290508n3729b37eqae068b7653b16333@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have a series of VTK legacy ASCII files  representing my CFD structured
data.
Each file contains the data for a given computational block (ie, adjacent
grids).
I'd like to link all of these files (file_1.vtk, file_2.vtk, ...) with an
xml based file (such as a *.pvd file)
so I could easily open them within a ParaView "session"...
How can I do this?

Thanks,
Fletcher

Ok, I just recompiled Mesa (without Mangling), and reconfigured VTK to link
against the Mesa libGL/libGLU and enabled the "OSMesa" options... and Viola,
it works like a champ.. and it's 10x easier to setup than Mangling.

So maybe mangling isn't really necessary anymore, except for those times
where you need to switch between Hardware OpengL & Mesa on the fly.. Anyone
actually doing that tho?

Subject: [Paraview] glx.h, glXGetProcAddressARB, debian build
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0612291545200.1983@localhost.localdomain>


Hi

  I've gotten the last paraview from the cvs. I'm building it on a debian 
machine and get the following error:

  Determining if glXGetProcAddressARB exists in GL/glx.h FALSE with the 
following output:
  <supressed>

/home/rreis/on_hold/paraview/ParaView/VTK/Rendering/CheckglXGetProcAddressARB.cxx: 
In function 'int main(int, char**)':
/home/rreis/on_hold/paraview/ParaView/VTK/Rendering/CheckglXGetProcAddressARB.cxx:33: 
error: 'glXGetProcAddressARB' was not declared in this
scope

  So I think my particular openGL stuff isn't quite up to it. I've 
installed the package libgl1-mesa-dev to provide my openGL stuff. the 
debian site also lists the following packages providing the file glx.h:

    libdevel/libgl1-mesa-dev
    x11/nvidia-glx-legacy-dev
    x11/nvidia-glx-dev
    libdevel/libgl1-mesa-swx11-dev

   i don't have a nvidia card so I'm discarding these two and the 
mesa-swx11 want's to kill my xorg. any ideas? what are the openGL 
implementations recommended for Linux intel 32 bit platforms on  Linux?

  thanks for your input,

Hello

I captured the OpenGL stream of paraview 2.4, and found that paraview seldom utilize Display List or Vertex Array to draw the the visual objects. I think it make the paraview can not run very fast, does it?

The original purpose of the mangled mesa extension was a heterogeneous
configuration with hardware acceleration and OS rendering at the same
time. It was a long time ago, so I've forgotten the exact configuration. I
know SGI pipes were part of the mix. This was in the parallel VTK days;
ParaView did not exist, therefore no client/server architecture etc...

One application is rendering extremely large offscreen imagery using
mangled Mesa (limited by memory)  and hardware accelerated rendering
smaller imagery for onscreen interactive use. This requires both libraries
in the same executable.

Brian, what is the maintainence issue? What is the current cost etc.?

Subject: [Paraview] Itanium2 Rendering Problem
Message-ID: <C95001D211F35C8C6B30AB59@harpo.psc.edu>

We are seeing a rendering error where some polygons just disappear at certain viewing angles.

   - ParaView 2.4.4 (compiled to use only 1 CPU)
   - Mesa 6.4.2 using "linux" configuration
   - 16 Itanium2 IA-64 1.3 GHz dual core nodes (32 CPUs total)
   - 3 Gb memory
   - Suse SLES8
   - viewing surface of data from VTK file with cell type VTK_TETRA

I used ParaView to make a short MPEG movie. As the object is rotated pieces of the top surface disappear then return. Two frames of the movie are attached. The whole movie is available via anonymous ftp at ftp.psc.edu under

   pub/outgoing/eschenbe/Mesa

The VTK file displays fine elsewhere. Built-in objects (sphere, cylinder, etc.) look fine. I also tried a half-dozen of the demos that came with Mesa and saw no problems. I cannot reproduce the problem using parallel projection.

The problem is seen with both standalone paraview and when running the server on that system with composition on (i.e., rendering via Mesa). Using the server with composition off (i.e., rendering on the client workstation using its graphics card) shows
no problems. Thus it seems like this might be a Mesa problem.

I'd be interested in any ideas or further tests. TIA!
