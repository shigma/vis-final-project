Dear ParaView Developers

I've been trying to run Paraview (v.1.8.2) in client/server mode as
exemplified in page 91 of the Paraview Guide over a two very simple Windows
system (2 AMD Athlons running Win2K conected through a TCP/IP network over a
10/100 swith), but when I tried to open my data file in the client machine
(menu File\Open data) I received the following message from the machine
runing the pvserver:

"ERROR: In
C:\martink\ParaView\ParaView18\Servers\Filters\vtkPVServerFileListing.cxx,
line 170 vtkPVServerFileListing(038555F0): Error calling FindNextFile:
Invalid identifier."

Is there any extra procedure not described in ParaView Guide to fix this
problem?

Thanks for any help

p.s.: I don't have a directory called "C:\martink" in my machine. I think
that this directory is regarding to "Ken Martin" ParaView's developer ;-)

What is the name of the directory at which the dialog is pointing when 
you get this error?

I think we found the problem.   It is a bit complicated, but I think
if you run paraview in non-client/server mode, and open a file in a directory
that exists on BOTH machines.   Then run client/server it should work.
I think the problem is the recently used file is in a directory that does
not exist on the server machine, and due to a bug in the file chooser it gets
stuck and you can't load any files.

Hello

When opening vtk files information like range, size,... is avaliable
on the "information" tab. Is it possible to get such statistics 
(e.g. MAX value, MIN value) for a whole animation (which is 
a set of vtk files in my case) maybe even programmatically
in scripts?

thanks in advance

Hi Renato,

Do you mean within a single ParaView session?  If so, then from the View 
menu, select "3D View Properties" and click on the Camera tab.  Near the 
top of that tab is a section called "Stored Camera Positions".  Right-click 
on one of the buttons in that section to save the current camera position 
in that button.  (A small image of the current state of the display area 
will be drawn on that button.)  After changing the camera position, you can 
restore it by left-clicking on the button where you previously stored the 
camera information.

I will reformulate my question better...

I know that Paraview is able to save the camera position through "camera
painel" (right click on an empty panel button), but, I'd like to reproduce a
specific camera position for several Paraview sessions. Therefore, I was
think to save camera parameters to a file and restore these parameters in
another Paraview session. If it's possible, how could I do that?

Sounds like you need the bleeding edge "Lookmarks" feature.  Unfortunately,
I'm not sure which version will include it.

Renato,

Lookmarks will allow you to create a "visual bookmark" of a view of your
data. It leverages the "Save Session State" feature currently in
ParaView but has the added benefit of letting you apply multiple
lookmarks to a single dataset and changing the dataset to which a
lookmark is applied all in the same paraview session. There is also a
Lookmark Manager which let's you view and organize your lookmarks
(represented by a thumbnail, name, dataset name, and comments field).
You can save the lookmarks in the Lookmark Manager to a file that can
then be "imported" into a different paraview session. I could also add
an option to "only save camera settings" to replace the functionality in
the Camera tab. As far as availability goes, I am working with Kitware
to get it into standard ParaView. Shouldn't be too much longer.

Best,

Eric

I found out a possible solution...

I see that when a state file is saved, Paraview record a command line
regarding to camera position. This line is something like:

"SetCameraState 7.24881 -31.6254 -0.072037 1.44765 89.1608 -0.295244
-8.85497e-005 0.0018437 0.999998"

If this line (and others regarding camera issues) is saved to another file
and loaded through "file\load session" Paraview get these parameters and
plays them.

Subject: [Paraview] Quadratic elements visualisation
Message-ID: <41E63CA7.1040901@inpro.de>

Dear paraview users and developer's,
i'm using paraview 1.8.2 and vtk-4.4 on linux and windows, and have the
following questions:

I want to add new quadratic elements (like a quadratic quad with center
point) to vtk and i want to visualize them in vtk like in paraview with
the "TempTessellatorFilter". But the "TempTessellatorFilter" is not a
part of vtk and it is marked
as temporary in paraview. So want i know if there is another way to
visualize quadratic elements with curved surface
in vtk 4.4 or in future versions of vtk, or is that only a feature of
paraview which will be not implemented in vtk?

Thanks alot and best regards
S?ren Gebbert

S?ren,

	I'd say that this should be fairly easy to copy/paste/modify the class 
vtkQuadraticQuad. As internally we are already using the center point 
you are trying to add. I have seen other people from vtkusers mailing 
list have attempted this solution.

	As for your second question about the fact that TessellatorFilter is 
marked as Temp is because we are working on a more generic approach than 
this filter. You'll find more information in VTK, especially in the 
VTK/GenericFiltering subdir.

I'm trying to use pvbatch to preprocess large datasets by running filters (e.g. contours), and then writing those contours to .pvd filesets. However such a paraview session uses WriteVTKFile, which is found in paraview but not pvbatch. Perhaps that's why the 'Save Data' step isn't recorded to the batch script.

I think WriteVTKFile ultimately boils down to vtkXMLPVDWriter::WriteData, so I think that's what I should be calling. Has anybody done this? Is it possible? Thanks,

Lee

Hey,

I made the observation, that Gouraud shading is always working for spheres. 
But for iso-planes it is only working on some machines. Should I look closer 
why it is working only sometimes, or is it a known problem?

Reading in a PVTI containing e.g. 32 pieces with 16 processors only gives me 
half of the data. Reading it in with either 32 or 1 processor(s) works 
correct? Is this known?

I use paraview 1.8.2.

This is known. And it is really not a problem but a feature :-) The
patented algorithms that computes the isosurfaces for structured
datasets can also compute normals. If use any other algorithm or input
type, no normals will be generated during isosurface computation. To
get smooth shading, you have to apply the normals generation filter to
the isosurface.

This is a known problem and I believe is in our list of things to fix.

Isn't Gouraud and flat shading the same for planes? I'd think one would 
want the faster flat shading for planes.

Hello,

	I am having a little trouble in starting Paraview with MPI. I have

my command-line to start the server:

I get an error stating there is a problem parsing a command-line
argument, -p4pg and then the options for paraview and then am returned
to the command-line. I believe the -p4pg argument has something to do
with MPICH, but I can't exactly figure where the argument is being
thrown in. If anyone knows of this problem and has a solution any help
would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

You must have a paraview that is compiled without mpi support, the
binary on Kitware web site for example. You have to compile paraview
from source and enable mpi support.

 From what I remember mpirun passes all info to other nodes via 
commandline arguments. It will add arguments like -p4pg (which gives the 
exact path of the executable per processor) when starting the other 
nodes which they then filter out. Add a few echo statements to mpirun (I 
think there is even a command line option to print some more info)

Could it be that Paraview expects LAM (which adds different commandline 
args)?

By the way we found LAM to be more reliable than mpich (we stopped using 
it at mpich1.2.4 so maybe it has improved)

Subject: [Paraview] Reloading changed data
Message-ID: <ridacr5fgen.fsf@gcdw42.cdratfd.unileoben.ac.at>


I'm using ParaView (v 1.8) to visualize data from a simulation program
I am currently developing.

My problem is the following: during development I usually do
simulations on rather small data sets, but I do them often (every time
I change something in the program).

Usually ParaView is running. After each run the data on the disk has
changed, but ParaView doesn't know this (which is perfectly
understandable). 

My question: is there a way to tell ParaView to reread the data from
the disk? I tried the "Reset" Button of the data importer, but this
doesn't change anything.

The only workaround I found was to have two "timesteps" in the
DataImporter and switch between them with the slider.

The other possibility would be to delete the Importer and create a new
one, which is even less satisfying.

Is there a way to reload the data in current versions? If no: would it
be possible to add such a capability to the GUI?

Subject: [Paraview] batch mode problem in CVS version?
Message-ID: <20050119222351.6813D1A812@aquila.cscs.ch>

Hello

I am running the CVS version from this morning on a Linux system (gcc
2.9). After loading a time-dependent EnSight case file with multiple outputs, I
have 2 problems running the animation in batch mode:

1) All InputMask of the ExtractParts are set to 0 in this manner:

[$pvTemp1346 GetProperty InputMask] SetElement 0 0

etc...

If I correct the batch script by hand by putting the 1s in the second
column, it executes correctly. With all 0s, I have of course no
images. :-(

2) Seems like the batch script writer assumes a Perspective Camera. Unlike
the "Save State" which correctly saves the CameraParallelScale value
and a Parallel Projection flag, the "Save Batch" menu does not save these
values. I tried to do it by hand, guessing the correct syntax to force
Parallel Projection and a ParallelScale, but did not succeed. I guessed
wrong or it is not supported. What's the trick?

Thanks for the help.

Hi all
I am working on a different file formats, there in my polyData
(vtkPolyData) number of cells (Triangles) are very high (approx
40,000), because of that I am facing performance problem, all my newly
writtened filters are becomming very slow.
Now I planned to use VTK decimation filters to reduce the number of
cells in my polydata.
I want know using decimation filters helps  in solving my problem, and
also to know decimation filters affect the attrbutes of the points.
Or else where I will get the complete information about these
decimation filters.

Is there any other solution to solve my problem.

Thanks in Advance

Subject: [Paraview] A name="abc" feature *.pvd?
Message-ID: <001b01c4ffe2$424b0100$6e01a8c0@last>

Dear paraview users and developer's,

I'm using paraview 1.8.3 on linux and windows.

I have the following question: Is there a name-feature 
in the *.pvd file whereby I can assign a descriptive 
string to each part that will then show in the face-sheet
for the "Extract Parts" filter?   

Something like:  name="Traction BC"

ParaView is a most incredible post-processor!!! My
meshes have side-sets, node-sets, and element-sets
that are referenced by boundary conditions etc. in my
analysis program.  I have successfully written out the
individual item-sets as vtk unstructured mesh objects.  

I then use a *.pvd file to read in the mesh as part="1" 
and the node-sets, side-sets, and element-sets as
part="2" et cetera. When I use the "Extract Parts" filter, 
I get a list of parts ID'ed as "Unstructured Grid: nnn cells"

For a large complex model I have no idea how many 
cells are in each of the item-sets?  When I write out 
the *.pvd file from my analysis code, it would very very
useful ( and easy) to be able to attach a name-string
to each of the item-sets as I have already assigned 
names to these mesh objects in my analysis code.

If the feature is absent, what are the prospects of getting
it added to the "to-do list" for ParaView?

I read in the Paraview Guide that paraview automagically decides wether

with the command

mpirun -nolocal -np 2 -machinefile /usr/global/jsg3/machines.LINUX 
/usr/global/paraview-1.8.1/bin/paraview --server

which should use 2 machines from the machine list specified. I then 
connect with a client using

 paraview -c --host=128.118.xxx.xx

My question is why I dont see a process spawned on the second machine in 
the list?

It does create a file called PIxxxx with the following contents?

Message-ID: <20050124144321.9EA4.SUZ@mito.ssd.ssg.fujitsu.com>

Hello all.

I'm trying to controll ParaView with scripts interactively.
I know that ParaView is controlled by a batch script (.pvb) or a session
script (.pvs), and in these scripts we can find the segment to put a
value into the property.

Can I write the script(or command) to get property-values from the
objects?
For example, 
I can set the center of rotation with the following command.
	$kw(vtkTemp5) SetCenterOfRotation 3.273228 4.163779 2.862126

But if I didn't know the center of coordinates, can I get the bounds for
x,y,z to calculte this?

Hey,

why is the vtkGhostLevels array needed also for a structured grid 
(ImageData)? This information is already in the difference between the 
piece extend  of the pvti and the whole extent of the vti.
So why is it needed again?

Also very strange is, that I get the error message
vtkImageData (0x9c90d98): Point array vtkGhostLevels with 1 components, 
only has
 2317259 tuples but there are 2405700 points

Even though there is no "vtkGhostLevels" Array specified anywhere. AND I 
get this first for the 3rd frame.

The feature is not currently present and I think it is actually 
non-trivial to add.  With the new VTK pipeline it shouldn't be too hard 
to get the information propagated from the reader to the extract-parts 
filter, but we have higher priorities right now.

You can add a feature request here:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug

It should be safe to add the name="..." attribute to the .pvd file now. 
  It won't be used but it shouldn't hurt.  Then when the feature is 
implemented your old files will work automatically.

Roland,

Ghost levels are needed for images when they are processed by filters that 
do not know their input is an image (vtkDataSet API).

The error message indicates that the ghost levels are not being generated 
correctly, or that they are not being updated for the new frame.  This 
check keeps filters from looking past the end of an array and crashing 
paraview.

Charles.

Upon further investigation I discovered that the support was already 
there for the EnSight reader, so adding it to the XMLCollecitonReader 
was trivial.  It is present as of revision 1.10 of 
vtkXMLCollectionReader.cxx in the CVS version of ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Creating new widgets in paraview interface
Message-ID: <5A116463188A2540B67FD188A32D00B54EBD7F@wbrb07.ft.corp>

Hi

I am new to Paraview but have a little experience in tcl/tk. I am working with a project that involves sequential import of data from a transient CFD calculation. The import function is running via a script on a standard Paraview installation and works for now.

My problem is that i have been asked to extend the functionality of the import function, by placing a button and a checkbox in paraview to control manual/automatic import of the data. The -command part of the widgets is no problem, but i am having trouble getting the widgets displayed in the Paraview GUI 

I have tried to implement the widgets through standard tk with "." as the parent window. I get no error from Paraview but i dont get my widgets either. Does anyone know of a way to extend the left panel with user-programmable widgets, if possible with a script so it can be distributed with the standard Paraview installation. It would be nice if a new tab on the "Source" panel could be created that could hold them, so as not to clutter up the standard tabs.

The Tk widgets you see displayed are not directly created.  Look in 
GUI/Client/Resources/Readers.xml and similar files to see how the GUI 
components are configured.  To add a new widget with some special 
functionality you'll need to look at the other code in GUI/Client.  You 
can also get the ParaView Guide which has a developers section:

Unfortunately, you can't. The C++ API has methods to obtain this
information but some of the classes used are not Tcl wrapped. It would
be relatively easy to change this but unfortunately, I do not have
time to do it right now. You might want to add this to the bug tracker
as a feature request.

The decimation filter will copy/interpolate the attributes
appropriately. The way this is done depends on the filter. However,
you shouldn't need this in ParaView because of the LOD functionality.
Look at View -> 3D View Properties. The ParaView Guide has more
information on this.

Subject: [Paraview] Question about avi output
Message-ID: <004d01c5044e$8b5152d0$41c809c0@jupiter>

Hello,

For 1 month, I try to use Paraview to visualize the vtk output of a scientist software.

When I see the last version 1.8.3 I download it to see the last modifications.

I see in the last version, you add 2 files movies outputs : mp2 and avi.
First I use the mp2 and when I try to reload this files in application which read mp2 files. it gives me an file format error.
Second I try to use the avi output. And I have this error message :
"There was a VTK Error in file: C: martink ParaView ParaView18 GUI Client vtkAVIWriter.cxx (139)
 Unable to compress C:/TEMP/test.avi" in the Paraview Error log window

Could you explain me where is the problem ?

Thank you very much for your help.

Best regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Input XML data source
Message-ID: <BAY24-F3BACE244ED3F2EBD0AF2287780@phx.gbl>

Please help,

I have created an XML file that contains points and connectivity and am 
using this file to read as a source through "Xdmf Reader Reader" in 
Paraview. The data will load fine and display perfectly until I create a 
file with a large number of points. If I try to read in data with this large 
count of points paraview.exe throws an "unhandled exception". Is it my 
format or is it something to do with Paraview itself (I am using the Win32 
on Windows XP version)? I am very new to paraview and hopefully this is 
something simple.

Thanks to anyone with hint/help.

Sounds like a bad mp2 player. WindowsMediaPlayer with a mpeg2 codec works
fine for me.

This could be because of a recent change in Intel's licensing of their
indeo5 codec. We have since switched to a different codec for AVI which will
be in 1.8.4

Hello folks

I'm trying to evaluate the potential to use Paraview to visualize water
resources and hydrogeology data in 3D.  Can anybody help me with the
following questions?

a)  is there any way for paraview to import/display topographic base maps
(i.e. roads, streams) provided in a format such as AutoCAD DWG or DXF?
b)  Does Paraview include any 2D and 3D interpolation routines (i.e.
kriging) that would allow me to visualize randomly scattered data?
c)  Is the VTK format suitable for me to import and visualize
one-dimensional line segments?
d)  has anybody out there use Paraview for this type of application?

thanks,
David Van Vliet

I have reproduced the problem with your file.  There are two problems here:

1.) ParaView should not crash no matter the input given.  We'll fix that.

2.) You specify that the number of elements is 736 and the dimensions of 
the array are 736x3 but only give 368 elements.  If I change the 
736->368 then the crash goes away.

David,

I am not entirely qualified to answer your questions.
I am a relatively new user. My experience is that if
you will meet Paraview halfway, ParaView will provide
you with outstanding post-processing. The time spent
writing  *.pvd *.vtu *.pvtu etc files will pay huge dividends.

I checked the web and found free kriging packages, so
if you are willing to generate an intermediate grid of display 
points (with data) you can supply these to ParaView via one
 the XML-based vtk file formats. 

I have attached a *.pdf file that discribes the various vtk-based 
input-file options.  I must caution you, the document is concise, 
precise, complete and says it only once (and not where you 
might expect to find it as you are coding a file writer IMHO).

Writing a vtk-based input file for ParaView to read does
indeed allow you to enter one-dimensional line segments
(vtk_line or vtk_poly_line on page 9). ParaView does 
expect you to supply data with these lines if you want it
to display something other than the grid itself.

If you code in Fortran-90/95, I can send you (off line) example
coding to create vtk-based files for ParaView to read.

Regards,

Sam Key

Subject: [Paraview] Animating deforming geometry
Message-ID: <BE1FD46E.C1AA%pknotz@sandia.gov>

Hi,

I have a simulation where I compute mesh displacements and solutions to
equations on the displaced mesh.  I can view the deformed mesh in ParaView
using the warp (vector) filter and that works fine for a single time step.
However, when I got to make an animation I can view the deformation in time.
If I select the data file as the source then I can animate on time steps but
that's the undeformed mesh.  If I select the Warp filter as the source then
I can only animate on the scale factor, not time steps.  Is there anyway to
do such an animation in ParaView?  Or do I have to apply the displacements
to the coordinate data before loading it into ParaView?

On a related note, I'm using the ExodusII data reader (which does not ship
with the standard ParaView distribution).  This reader has a boolean option
called "Apply Displacements" but there's no documentation about what that's
supposed to do. Anyone familiar with that?

Thanks ~ Pat

Pat,

It is probably faster to ask these questions of paraview-help@sandia.gov
than of the paraview@paraview.org list, since they usually are at least
in part Sandia specific, and we are here to answer your questions.

When you select the undeformed mesh as the input, what you see in the
animation will be the deformed mesh as long as the warp filter is what
is visible. The animation menu uses the original input because that is
where the timesteps are. The animation menu then runs the whole pipeline
and shows you the output from whatever you have selected as visible.

The "Apply Displacements" check box should automatically do the same
thing as the warp filter, as long as the reader can recognize your
displacement vector (if it uses one of the usual names like displ it
should find it, but you can't select something else like you can with
the warp filter).

ship with the standard ParaView distribution).  This reader has a
boolean option called "Apply Displacements" but there's no documentation
about what that's supposed to do. Anyone familiar with that?

Thanks ~ Pat

Subject: [Paraview] Animating deforming geometry

Hi John,

Thanks for the insight.  It might be a nice enhancement if the ExodusII
reader let you specify the field to use as the displacements.

I also came to realize that I could animate the deformed geometry (like you
said) once.  On subsequent attempts it looked like ParaView was caching the
geometry.  I can either re-load the first time step manually or disable he
geometry caching and then re-enable it to make it work...

Thanks ~ Pat

Subject: [Paraview] Confusion Over Proper Use of *.pvd Files

Greetings Developers & Users,

It looks to me that I don't understand something
about the interaction of *.pvd files and animation?

I have a file called "abc.results.pvd"   It is a 'Collection'
file with entries like --
    <DataSet timestep="001" part="001" file="abc.m001.t001.vtu" name="rst"/>
The 'timestep' entries run from 001 to 100.
The 'part' entries run from 001 to 004.
That is, I have files for 100 time steps by four parts -- 400 entries.

The source face-sheet works just fine -- I have a single 4-part
object that can be sliced and diced with the Extract Parts
filter, and a time-step slider that runs from 0 to 99 that lets
me examine results at any time step (the deformation is
incorporated into the x,y,z-coordinates of the object at
each time step and is large enough to be easily visable).

Animation.
When I go to animation and select Source as abc.results.pvd,
the Parameter selection offers either Timesteps or Filename
for which I choose Timesteps. The face-sheet correctly shows
that there are 0 to 99 time steps in the object's data set.

Now The Problem.
Only part="001" is animated.  The remaining three parts
are not processed by the animation???  (I can tell visually
and by the time it takes to perform the animation.)

Alternate Approach Tried.
I surmised that the animation-engine might be confused
about the grouping since 'timestep' and 'part' were at the
same level, so I created a family of 100 files "abc.tnnn.pvd"
where nnn ran from 001 to 100, that is, the entries were of
the form
    <DataSet part="001" file="abc.m001.t001.vtu" name="rst"/>
The PVDReader was only asked to group 'parts.' Again the
source face-sheet worked as before now seeing the time steps
via the sequential file names.

Animation --Same Problem as Before.
The Parameter selection this time was by Filename and
100 time steps were appropriately identified. However,
as before, only the portion of the object identified by
part="001" was animated???

Where am I going wrong?

Regards,

SamKey
(ps: name="rst" is a new entry that will show up on the
Extract Parts filter face sheet in PV version 1.10, courtesy
of Brad King -- a very welcome addition for ease-of-use.)
