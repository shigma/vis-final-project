I've managed to make part of it working on a Python level (I got too
many problems with wrapping mixed wxWidgets/VTK C++ class).

So I exposed PVGenericRWI and few other classes through ParaView Python
wrappers. I also made PVGenericRWI fire RenderEvent when it is about
to call Render or EventuallyRender on PVRenderViewProxy. This way
I can setup a Python callback and update render module proxy when
necessary. I've attached a proper patch for ParaView CVS version if 
someone is ineterested.

Now it looks like this:
+---------------+  ----- forwarding events ----->  +--------------+
|  wxVTKRWI.py  |                                  | PVGenericRWI |
+---------------+  <---- render callbacks -------  +--------------+

I also attached a modified wxVTKRenderWindowInteractor.py class with
an example.

But there is still a big problem - when I run this script with
MPI (through pvpython) only data from *one* server is rendered...
I have to admit that I don't understand how Server Manager
composes data from multiple servers yet.
If someone could provide some source of documentation on this subject
I'd appreciate (ParaView book doesn't describe internals).

Best regards,
	Wiktor

Jack,
 
This problem is brought up over and over again. We should certainly do a better job of letting people know exactly how the geometry delivery and compositing work in ParaView.
 
1) ParaView can work in client/server mode two ways
    a) Delivery geometry to the client
    b) Open windows on the server, render pieces, composite, and deliver images to the client
 
2) ParaView has a control under 3DView properties called 'Composite' the default is 10MB.
 
 
What is happening is that for many datasets your geometry is under 10MB so it gets delivered to your client. When the geometry is more than 10MB ParaView tries to open X-windows on the servers (fails) and you get the message below. 
 
So you should set up your servers so that processes can open up an X-windows. Note: The default x/security settings will not allow this and you (or your cluster admin will have to set this up).
 
Alternative 1) Compile paraview with mesa. Good option if your servers don't have graphics cards. Obviously a bad solution of your servers have cards.
 
Alternative 2) Turn compositing off all together, again not a good long term solution but will get you up and running quickly.
 
Steve (Monk), can you provide a 'how to' for setting up X to allow processes to open up windows and send to this list?
 
Best,

You need to run a different version of VNC.  One that supports GLX, which
is really OpenGL.   Or, you could run paraview in client server mode with
the server running on the SGI, and the client running on Windows.

Renato,
 
As Bill has alluded to, you should certainly be using the image delivery feature of ParaView. It works remarkably well. :)
 
Start up a server on the SGI and start up a client on your windows box.
 
Go to 3D View properties, make sure compositing is 'on' and slide the threshold to 0MB, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at the image delivery performance you get (some folks don't even realize what's happening... :)

Subject: [Paraview] Running Paraview on an SMP machine
Message-ID: <2B55CE3E-ED47-4893-818D-9812F9E34724@northwestern.edu>

Hi - I am new to the use of parallel visualization, and wanted to  
check it out a bit. I have several questions about using Paraview on  
an SMP (dual proc or otherwise) machine:

- When starting paraview in parallel - is the typical usage to start  
in client-server (so pvclient and pvrenderserver) mode with a  
multiprocess server or to start in distributed stand-alone mode  
(paraview)? Are there particular reasons to choose one over the other?

- The older online docs mention that if several processes share a  
display, the render windows may overlap and the resulting image may  
be corrupt. what is the typical way around this?

-  In goofing around, I tried adding the --use-offscreen-rendering  
flag to pvrenderserver, but still render windows appeared for the  
processes. Is this a sign that I don't have mesa installed or set up  
properly?

- In order to take advantage of the parallel rendering - would I need  
to feed decomposed data files into the program, or does it handle  
this internally? Also - Other than checking speedup in rendering, how  
can one check that the rendering is actually being done in parallel  
vs. duplicated on each process?


Thanks in advance,

Dave

Replace line 174 with:

I fixed this on CVS head a while ago. Amy, can you check if this is

If I am running on an smp machine, I usually use:
mpirun -np 2 paraview
If you are running on one machine (no client/server separation), I
don't see why you would use client/server or client/render server/data
server.

If your geometry is not too large, you will notice that this is not an
issue. This is because paraview renders small geometry on the first
node (or client). How small small is is controlled by a threshold
parameter on the 3D view setting page. If you are running on the same
machine, I don't see why you should use compositing. You will be using
the same graphics card and you might as well render on the first node.
Just disable "Composite" from 3D view settings.

I'm deeply impressed that you managed to get

"small small is is"

into a paraview related email (comma anyone?). 

It reminds me of the question, how can you get the word "and" into a sentence five times in a row ...

A bloke is painting a new sign for the pub, and the pub is called "The Dog and Donkey" (Or some other wildly unlikely combination like "Frog and Ferret", "Badger and Banana", etc etc). A chap who is wandering passed says... "Hmmm, that sign doesn't look right, you've made the gaps between Dog and and, and, and and Donkey different sizes"

Thankyou for reading. Please feel free to go back to work now.

Since we are talking about grammar anyway, technically, those commas in
the middle of the ands shouldn't be there (which, ironically, makes the
sentence even more confusing and entertaining): "gaps between Dog and
and and and and Donkey."  You could, however, clear up the sentence by
quoting the ands that are taken from the sign: "gaps between 'Dog' and
'and' and 'and' and 'Donkey.'"

Thanks Ken,

Awfully sorry, the commas were deliberately introduced for emphasis (I'm 
the only native English Speaker in my office and had to explain this 
posting) and left as an excercise for the terribly well educated (well 
done, you passed, quoting the "and's" is much better) to find and 
criticise. After I posted this, I wondered if there were any variations 
and google did not let me down.

Wouldn't the sentence "I want to put a hyphen between the words Fish and 
And and And and Chips in my Fish-And-Chips sign" have been clearer if 
quotation marks had been placed before Fish, and between Fish and and, 
and and and And, and And and and, and and and And, and And and and, and 
and and Chips, as well as after Chips?"

And to save anyone the pain of counting (!), there are 21 (I think) 
and's in there. Capitalization and comma's left to the unwary to decode.

Subject: [Paraview] Pb with space in path
Message-ID: <02fe01c5b3c9$640cb540$41c809c0@jupiter>

Hello,

I try to load automatically my vtk file when I run paraview.
For that I use the command
>>> paraview.exe --data=.../toto.vtk

All it's ok when the path to the vtk doesn't contain any space.
When my path have a space : ex : C:\Program Files\Paraview\Examples\... paraview doesn't appear.
So I try to encapsulate the path and the name with ". In this case no path work (with or without path).

Could you see this problem.

For information, the same thing work for the pvs files if I encapsulate the parameter with ".

Best regards,

Hi,

We loaded an avs file with 9 million tets (about 900Mb). The file
apparently loaded, but when we went to visualize it, the OS session
froze and we were forced to hard reboot. Twice. On two different
machines. Each box has 4Gb memory. Are we barking up the wrong tree? Is
there a more suitable format? Any advice (besides a smaller mesh)?

- How much memory does Paraview use at the point of crash? Maybe your 
kernel only supports two Gb per process?
- Maybe the triangle strips or immediate rendering option causes extra 
memory use?
- Can you split the file and run paraview in parallel ?

Thank you, I try :-) I am a big fan of careful use of comma. I think
it is overused. Hence "how small small is is" instead of, maybe, "how
small small is, is".

here's the story:  sgi MIPSpro compiler 7.4 (I think).

I've been able to get previous versions to compile and run on MipsPro 7.4.3.  What compile settings are you using and what are you looking to build (64-bit, 32-bit, parallel, etc)?  Also, what error does the executable give you when you run it?

Hi,
The latest windows installer of Paraview 2.2.1 does not play the demo.  As I have to do a presentation on Paraview this week,  a speedy fix would be very helpful (I am assuming it is a small fix).  Here is a short synopsis:

On Windows XP, using the latest installer, choosing to play the demo from the help menu yields:

  Could not find Demo1.pvs in the installation or build directory.  Please make sure Paraview is installed properly.
There were no errors during the installation and the default parameters for all items were accepted.  Also, I tried running the demo from the command line to no avail.  Finally, I tried to manually load Demo1.pvs, only to be instructed to run the demo from the menu.



thanks,
Arash

Hello,

I see in the last version 2.2.1 of Paraview, I can't load the pvs files generate with a previous version 1.8 and 2.0 too.
I use pvs and I build a set of pvs to load automatically some computation results with the good set of command.

So must I rebuild all my pvs with the lastest version or it's Paraview bug which will be corrected ?
And in the futur, will you insure the compatibility with the previous version of pvs files ?

Hi Qinghuai,

You'll need to run ParaView in client/server mode (or client/data 
server/render server mode), and pass the -tdx and -tdy options to the 
client.  You need one server (or render server) node per tile.  For 
example, the following would work with ParaView built with MPICH (for 
MPI support) -- 4 server nodes and a 2 x 2 tiled display.

mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver
./pvclient -tdx=2 -tdy=2

Subject: [Paraview] File format for reading binary data in parallel
Message-ID: <20050912163350.25029.qmail@tools.lolipop.jp>

Hello, All.

 Which file-format should I choose when I want to read binary data (StructuredGrid)
 in paralle ?

 A .vts file can include binary parts, but I think it must be base64-encoded format.

 Is it better to use Ensight-format?


Best regards..

Amy :

Thanks for the guidiance.  How the client know where are the servers?
Should I define the configuration file?  Or I need to pass more command
line options?  Or since the server head node and the client on the same
machine so they can connect automatically?

Before we upgraded to mipspro 7.4.3 I had no problem with ParaView 1.8.5 nor 2.0.2.

I've been able to get previous versions to compile and run on MipsPro 7.4.3.  What compile settings are you using and what are you looking to build (64-bit, 32-bit, parallel, etc)?  Also, what error does the executable give you when you run it?

Paraview compiles with no errors, but the executable fails.

I would use .vts. Base64 encoding and compression are optional. Also
the current vtk contains a C interface for writing .vts out, I
believe.

Qinghuai,

If you are running ParaView with a separate data server and a render 
server, then you need to specify the machines to be used in the 
render server.  For recent versions of ParaView (2.0.2 and later), 
this specification goes in a .pvx file.  An explanation of the format 
can be found here: 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:FAQ#How_do_I_specify_the_list_of_machines_in_the_render_server_in_ParaView_2.2_and_later.3F.

To tell the client where the servers are, use the --data-server-host 
(-dsh)and --render-server-host (-rsh) command-line arguments.  The 
values for these command-line arguments are the names of the first 
node of the data and render servers, respectively.  You also need to 
use the --client-render-server (-crs) command-line argument for the 
client.  (See below.)

./pvclient -crs -dsh=data0 -rsh=render0

Hi,

just started to use the probe filter including the
csv-export with Renato's help :-) It works nice, but now I
would like to do it in batch-mode using pvbatch.
I am not sure if it is possible!? Taking a look at the
produced batch-file ('Saved Batch Script') I see the
produced the probe filter, but no output csv-file
declaration.

Greetings!
Fabian

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20050913123729.02cf09f0@pop.mcs.anl.gov>



My AMR reader is part of the server.  My custom GUI is part of the client.  My GUI needs to determine whether the AMR data just read is cell-centered or point-centered, so it will know whether it must further convert cell-centered to point-centered before an isosurface is possible.

Is there a method I can call from the client -- maybe vtkPVSource -> Get<Something>() -> Get<Something>() -> Get<Something>() -- that will tell me whether the data is cell-centered or point-centered?

(I see there are vtkBridgeAttribute::GetCentering() and vtkGenericAttribute::GetCentering(), but haven't determined how to get to them, yet.)

Thanks.

vtkPVSource->GetDataInformation() 
will return a data structure that has information about the output of
the reader. Then you need to get PointDataInformation and/or
CellDataInformation and check if they have arrays. Check
Servers/Common/vtkPVDataInformation.h for more info.

Thanks, Berk.  It looks like that will do.  (I'd been down most of that road, but gotten diverted to a sidestreet, and lost my way.
I'd tried vtkPVSource->GetDataInformation->GetNumberOf[Points() | Cells()], but regardless the centering, those both gave non-zero totals.... )

All,
Does anyone know how the pick filter lists the order of the points of a hexahedral cell?  I need to verify the connectivity of hexahedral cells.  I was under the impression that I could use the pick filter to pick a cell and view the connectivity but I'm not getting the connectivity I expected.  
 
Thanks in advance,

the bottom and top faces of the hexahedron are as follows.

Thank you, Mr.Geveci.

>I would use .vts. Base64 encoding and compression are optional. 

At first I think so and tried to read .vts file which contains raw binary data ,
but I failed to read.
Should I specify some special options for AppendedData tag or VTKFile tag ? 


Error message and .vts file are following.

Amy,
Thanks for the information.  Now here is another question ;)  I expected to get the point order as you stated:
(bottom)        (top)
  3    2           7     6
  0    1           4     5
 
But the order that I am seeing is:
 
(bottom)        (top)
   2     3         6     7
   0     1         4     5

That's the ordering for VTK_VOXEL.  Are you sure the cells in your 
data are hexahedra, not voxels?

Hello,
I am relatively new to paraview. I need to view an unstructured mesh
(defined as points+segments) where I want to plot the cells (=segments)
with a line width corresponding to their scalar field values. Is that
possible?
thanks a lot,

Yes it is, although potentially memory consuming:

* apply extract edges or extract surface
* apply tube and set "vary radius" to on

You should add the attribute

  byte_order="LittleEndian"

to the VTKData at the top.  If your binary data is in big endian order
then instead add

  byte_order="BigEndian"

The format for raw appended binary data should be

<AppendedData encoding="raw">
  _NNNN...........................
</AppendedData>

Where the underscore is literal (as you already have) and the NNNN is a
four-byte block containing an unsigned 32-bit count of the number of
"words" in the array.  A word is one value of the type of the array, so
in your case the NNNN would have the number of float values.  Then the
number of bytes of binary data to follow should be NNNN*sizeof(float).

If you have another appended data array in the same file then start it
immediately after the end of the first array (with no newline or any
other character.  Then specify in the offset="..." attribute for the
corresponding DataArray the number of bytes beyond the underscore where
the second array begins.

Thanks a lot for the feedback, unfortunately, I can succesfully colorize
the edges according to the widths (so the widths are there), but "vary
radius" (="by scalar") has absolutely no effect, just "radius" constant
value is taken. Other parametes do not change anything either. What am I
doing wrong?

thanks a lot

I notice that, in the email from June that I've included below, you mention "Comparative visualization".  Is that only provided by the calculator filter, or is there also some other way this is done?

I need to be able to compare 2 datasets that represent the same time step of different runs on the same data domain.

Can 2 datasets be compared in paraview, or can I only compare arrays that are in a single dataset?

If the latter, is there a way, in paraview, once I've read 2 datasets, to combine arrays from them into a single "entity" so they can be compared?


Thanks.

 I didn't know raw option ! Thank you for your advice!

 I created .vts file again, and tried to read by ParaView.
 But the same error occurred....

 I will try some case. Thank you..

I found by experimenting, that the filter works only with the nodal
values, whereas I tried cell values before. I am glad with the results,
although it's a bit confusing, as the widths given per cell should be
visualized here as well (constant width over the segment as opposed to
scaling when the nodal values are used).
thanks a lot and regards,
Dominik

I am modifying a CFD code to write unstructured grid results in legacy 
vtk format. The type of output data is quite simple: an unstructured 
surface mesh of arbitrary polygon cells with a number of scalar 
properties assigned to each cell.

I have completed the geometry part no problem, but I cannot find (or at 
least cannot understand what I have found!) a good description of the 
file format for the data.

Should I use repeated blocks of CELL_DATA, SCALARS. or should I use a 
FIELD, with each scalar in one array of the field.
Regarding the FIELD data, I couldn't see how the data in the arrays 
would 'know' whether it was assigned to CELLs or to POINTS.

OR

Should I write the whole thing in the XML format?

Many thanks in advance

I use FIELD. E.g.

POINT_DATA 882
FIELD attributes 2
p 1 882 float
..
U 3 882 float
..


(never tried the xml format though)

Hi Fabian,

You can not save the plot from within the batch script currently, but if 
you apply the attached patch to the current CVS tree code you will be 
able to.

To do so:
1) Apply the patch.
2) Recompile.
3) Create your batch script.
4) Edit the batch script. Look for the two lines like these and take 
note of the variable name (in this case pvTemp632).

$pvTemp632 UpdateVTKObjects
# Plot's .csv file name is 
/home/demarle/Kitware/ParaView/devel/build/probe.csv

5) At the end of your script add a line like this:

$pvTemp632 PrintAsCSV 
{/home/demarle/Kitware/ParaView/devel/build/MyNewFileName.csv}

Just before this line:
$proxyManager UnRegisterProxies

I will check in something like this patch with some temporal plotting 
code revisions soon.

cheers
Dave DeMarle

A quick question on how to run paraview with sort-last on several
graphic devices in the same machine.  Should I use the MPI version, or
the client-server model?  How can I provide the graphic card device name
to Paraview render servers, or Paraview servers?  Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] adding TCL filter / vorticity
Message-ID: <1126858422.6283.17.camel@localhost>

Hello,


I have found some info on the list on how to add a custom c++ filter to
the "Filter" menu, BUT no clue if a custom tcl script can be added
somehow.

Is this possible, or do I have to rewrite the tcl script in c++?

The script is very simple. It uses just one vtk class (vtkCellDerivs) to
calculate the vorticity of a vector field. That's it! 
Read in the data, calculate vorticity vector, write out data.

So far I have been using it by hand before loading the output in
Paraview, but I would like to integrate it into Paraview.

Any help/hint would be appreciated.


Thanks, Simone

I think this is the PDF you were referencing:

click on the "VTK Technical Documents" link in the column on the

Hello Everyone,

Kitware will be hosting a VTK / ParaView / ITK "Birds-Of-A-Feather" (BOF) 
meeting in Minneapolis, Minnesota as part of the Visualization '05 
conference. Tentatively, this will take place on Tuesday October 25th, from 
7pm to 9pm. We see this as an opportunity for folks working with these open 
source projects to meet, share past experiences, and discuss future needs. 
Toward this goal, I would like to invite users and developers of these 
projects to make some short (approximately 5 to 10 minutes) presentations - 
perhaps a case study of how you are using the software, some recent 
extensions that you have made to the software, or  future directions that 
you would like to see the software take.

If you plan to attend the Visualization conference and would like to make a 
presentation at this BOF, please send me (lisa.avila@kitware.com) a brief 
description of what you would like to cover by no latter than October 7th, 
2005. Remember, this presentation does not require a large amount of 
preparation - a few Power Point slides with some images / animations / 
descriptions of your work would be great. I think this meeting will be more 
valuable (and a lot more interesting) with participation from the whole 
community.

Thank you,

Message-ID: <058501c5bd10$353e9f30$41c809c0@jupiter>

Hello all,

As I have receive no answer about my question I send it again !!!
I need answer to know if I continue to work with pvs files to load automatically my cases with the good parameters or if I must find another way.

I see in the last version 2.2.1 of Paraview, I can't load the pvs files generate with a previous version 1.8 and 2.0 too.
I use pvs and I build a set of pvs to load automatically some computation results with the good set of command.

So must I rebuild all my pvs with the lastest version or it's Paraview bug which will be corrected ?
And in the futur, will you insure the compatibility with the previous version of pvs files ?

Best regards,

This is not a bug. There has been significant internal changes between
2.0 and 2.2 and the break in compatibility reflects this.
Unfortunately, the paraview scripts are highly dependent on the
programming interface of paraview and tend to break when this changes.
If you post some of the errors you get, someone might help you write a
script to fix your scripts.

> And in the futur, will you insure the compatibility with the previous

We will try. The paraview API is now more stable and we should be able
to buffer the scripting language from minor changes. However, paraview
is a growing project and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

Subject: [Paraview] Performance using ImmediateModeRenderingOff in pure vtk
	vs. Paraview
Message-ID: <432FD4E2.6030609@dkfz-heidelberg.de>

Hello,

In our lab we have a home grown vtk/itk based application framework for 
medical applications. I discovered a performance problem while working 
with Triangular meshes loaded from STL-Files. If the vtkProperties 
change (e.g. opacity), each rendering update takes extremely long 
(>10s). Using paraview, updates are possible at interactive speed 
(<0.5s). I tracked down the problem to a minimal example only using pure 
vtk (see attachment) and discovered, that in the function 
vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper::RenderPiece(...) new display lists are 
generated each time the properties of the actor have been modified. This 
is not the case, if ImmediateModeRendering is on. So my situation is: if 
ImmideateModeRendering is on, everything works as fast as expected, if 
ImmediateModeRendering is off, rendering updates are is really slow.

Now my question: how is rendering in paraview organized (optimized)? The 
render updates at opacity changes are always fast, no matter if 
ImmediateModeRendering is on or off.

Some Notes:

I am working on a laptop (2Ghz Pentium M, 2Gb RAM) under windows xp 
service pack 2.
My Compiler is Visual Studio .NET 2002
My graphics card is an ATI Mobility Radeon X600 with 128 MB RAM.
I am using the latest driver for the graphics adapter.
The STL-File I am working with has 30947 points and 61818 cells.
The problem does not appear on NVidia graphics adapters.

Thanks for any hints,

Max

Subject: [Paraview] Transforming an image
Message-ID: <432FF8C5.7020304@cs.huji.ac.il>

Hi all,

I'm trying to use Paraview to visually verify the registration between
two 3D images. I calculated the registration with an external
application and have obtained a 3x3 matrix that I'd like to apply to the
moving image within Paraview. I've managed to read the images into
Paraview (they're in MetaImage format), but unfortunately I can't apply
a Transform filter on the moving image's object (of class
vtkMetaImageReader). The filter is grayed out.

Is there some way I'm missing to apply a spatial transformation to the
image? I'm willing to enter the tranformation manually through the user
interface or, better yet, to enter it directly into the session file
(*.pvs). I will break the transformation matrix into a translation *
rotation * scaling if need be.

By the way, I noticed the MetaImage header has  a TransformMatrix field
but it doesn't seem to have any effect in Paraview.

Thanks,

- Aviv

Hi Renato,

Yes. In animation, the probe records the data values sampled after each 
frame. When the animation completes, the plot then shows how the values 
changed over time. Should you wish to change the probe's position during 
the animation, there are animation controls for its X, Y and Z coordinates.

cheers

 From what I remember from 3D graphics:

immediate mode rendering:render the primitives straight from the main 
memory.
non-immediate mode rendering: build a display list (kept in the graphics 
card memory). Is faster except when the list does not fit in the 
graphics memory. Also has to be rebuilt if any of the (properties of 
the) primitives changes.

So depending on your graphics card memory and also whether it natively 
supports opacity there might be big differences in performance between 
the two modes and between graphics cards.

Hallo,

thanks for your quick reply. Your comment is right, but what i observed 
implies, that there must be some implementation/parameterization issue 
influencing performance besides immediate mode rendering.

If I disable immediate mode rendering in paraview it behaves 10 times 
faster as my pure vtk example where immediate mode rendering is also 
off. So there must be an additional switch or trick which improves 
rendering preformance in paraview when immediate mode rendering is 
disabled...

Thanks,

Max

Hi all,
I will be holding a presentation on Paraview and wondered if anyone has related material he'd like to share with me.  I am looking for slides and brief hand outs.

thanks,
Arash

PS The "Demo" mode in the current release of Paraview is broken and does not run.  So if anyone has a related PVS file or script I can use for my demo, I appreciate it.

This has been fixed on the ParaView-2-2 branch, so it will work when 
the next patch release comes out.  Alternatively, if you are building 
ParaView yourself, update the source tree (through CVS), rebuild, and 
re-install; then it should work.

I have never used a machine with many graphics devices, but I can tell
you that to get parallel rendering to work you will need to run ParaView
in some kind of MPI mode.  The actual mode you use (local,
client/server, client/render-server/data-server) depends on your setup,
but they are all capable of parallel rendering.

Getting each process in your MPI job to use a different graphics device
may be more tricky.  Offhand, I can't think of an easy way to do it.
Perhaps you could have mpirun (or whatever launches your MPI jobs) call
a script that somehow determines the process' rank, sets the DISPLAY
accordingly, and then calls the real ParaView implementation.

Hello,

i also trid to convert the triangles into triangle strips using the 
class vtkStripper. This improved performance, but paraview is still more 
than twice as fast as the vtk example attached to my initial e-mail. 
strange...

Hi Fabian,

I think you could use a lookmark to setup your favorite view (including
scalar bar position) and reproduce to other data sets.

Hi Renato,

I did not use it yet, I first saw it the other time, when
you helped me with the ensight-probe-filter problem.
Thanks! The first steps using the lookmark-manager produced some
crashes, but probably I did something wrong ... I will try
it out more.

Greetings!

Message-ID: <4331A634.90301@cscs.ch>

Using the PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE my compilation is good, but I'm 
unsure about the xml inclusion part...

    *  To incldue Server manager XML:
 PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SERVERMANAGER_RESOURCES("${MYFANCY_SOURCE_DIR}/ServerManagerXML.xml")

    * To include GUI Client XML:
 PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_GUI_RESOURCES("${MYFANCY_SOURCE_DIR}/GUIXML.xml")

Normally the start of the GUI.xml would have
<ModuleInterfaces>
  <Library name="vtkCSCSNetCDFCS" directory="D:/cmakebuild/cscsp/bin"/>
  <ServerManagerFile name="vtkCSCSNetCDF.pvsm"/> />
  <Module name="NetCDF"
          class="vtkPVAdvancedReaderModule"

          module_type="Reader"
          extensions=".nc .cdf"
          file_description="NetCDF files">       
    <Source class="vtkNetCDFReader"/>
.....

but do I just skip the ModuleInterface/Library name/ServerManager stuff, 
or do I need to point them back to the Paraview kernel. Is there an 
example I can see anywhere.

Same question for the ServerManagerXML
<ServerManagerConfiguration>

Do I leave this alone, or modify it in any way?

Subject: [Paraview] Stereo support for GeoWall available?
Message-ID: <433296BF.2000805@christoph-moder.de>

Hello!

We have a GeoWall setup (http://www.geowall.org/) and would like to use 
Paraview there. It is driven by a Linux computer with a dual head 
graphics card, configured as a tiled display (each screen connector is 
linked to a projector with polarizing filter, thus creating 3D images).

So what I need is a stereo mode which displays the two pictures side by 
side, so they can be shown on different screens (instead of combined in 
a single red/blue picture). Is this possible? Can anyone explain how 
this can be done? I have already experimented with the patches listed 
below (and the current CVS version of Paraview), but without success.

My AMR reader reads 3d PARAMESH datasets -- octrees whose octants ("blocks") are regular grids of X^3 cell resolution.  Both the internal blocks and the leaves contain scalar data at the cell nodes or cell centers.

I've read two such datasets into paraview that represent consecutive time steps of the same data domain.  They have a greatest common refinement level (GCRL) -- that is, some refinement level that contains the same structure (number and size and cell resolution of blocks), but greater than which the two structures don't match.

I want to pass the GCRL's through the "Group Parts" filter and then through, say, the "Append Attributes" filter.  The GCRL's do not get through the "Group Parts" filter.

Should that work on the data structures I've described?

I'm using a development release from July 11.  Here are the error messages:

Subject: [Paraview] [LONG] Antialiasing with multisampling method
Message-ID: <4332D4F2.2070309@kitware.com>

Hi everybody,

Folks who are using VTK or ParaView under Unix may have noticed that
antialiasing in on by default. I wrote "may", because it actually depends on
your graphic configuration (graphic card and driver version).
In my case, Linux gentoo x86, NVidia GeForce 6800, driver 1.0-7676.

The consequence of that is some regression tests fail. Even if
VTK/Rendering/Testing/Cxx/vtkRegressionTestImage tries to handle this case,
some test like DistributedData-image fails because it uses compositing and
relies on the values in the color buffer.

In my case, a fast workaround is to run nvidia-settings, go to
"Antialiasing Settings" menu, check "Override Application Setting for
Antialiasing Settings" and set the value to "Off". But it is just a workaround.

So, why antialiasing is on? The short answer is multisampling. The long answer
is following. If you want to skip this explanation, there is a question at
the end of this message, which is actually the real purpose of this e-mail.

<long_answer>

With OpenGL, the usual way to deal with antialiasing for points, lines and
polygons is to call glDisable/Enable() respectively with argument
GL_POINT_SMOOTH, GL_LINE_SMOOTH or GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH (OpenGL Spec 1.5, section
3.3 page 74, section 3.4 page 77, section 3.5 page 84).
http://www.opengl.org/documentation/spec.html

In VTK, such calls appear in VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLRenderWindow. They are
controlled by some ivars defined in the superclass
VTK/Rendering/vtkRenderWindow with respectively Get/SetPointSmoothing(),
Get/SetLineSmoothing(), Get/SetPolygonSmoothing().

The other way is to use multisampling. It is part of core OpenGL since
OpenGL 1.3 and used to be ARB extension #5 (GL_ARB_multisample) that used to be
non-ARB extension #25 (GL_SGIS_multisample).
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/

As it is an expensive operation, it is not supported by all OpenGL contexts.
If you want to use it, you are supposed to obtain a multisample-capable context
using glX or WGL_ARB_multisample extension (OpenGL spec 1.5, F.3 page 281).

In VTK, superclass VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLRenderWindow has a MultiSamples
ivar and a static ivar GlobalMaximumNumberOfMultiSamples.
The default value of GlobalMaximumNumberOfMultiSamples is 8. The
default value for MultiSamples is GlobalMaximumNumberOfMultiSamples.

The MultiSamples ivar is actually used in the concrete class
VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow to query a multisample-capable context.
Here are the lines involved in function vtkXOpenGLRenderWindowTryForVisual():

  if (multisamples)
    {
#ifdef GLX_SAMPLE_BUFFERS_SGIS
    attributes[index++] = GLX_SAMPLE_BUFFERS_SGIS;
    attributes[index++] = 1;
    attributes[index++] = GLX_SAMPLES_SGIS;
    attributes[index++] = multisamples;
#endif
    }

It means you will get a multisampling context if ALL the following conditions
exist:
1. You are using Unix (there is a call to glXChooseVisual())
2. You compile VTK on a platform that have a version of glxext.h that
defines macro GLX_SAMPLE_BUFFERS_SGIS
3. You run VTK on a platform that supports some multisampling-capable context.

Once you get a multisampling-capable context, GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS is equal to 1.
At run time, the way to switch between multisampling or singlesampling
(it means no antialiasing) is to call glEnable/Disable with GL_MULTISAMPLE.

Here is the trap. By default, GL_MULTISAMPLE is on. In addition, if
GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS is equal to 1 and GL_MULTISAMPLE is on, multisampling is used
on points, lines and polygons *regardless* the value of GL_POINT_SMOOTH,
GL_LINE_SMOOTH and GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH (OpenGL spec 1.5, section 3.3.3 page 77,
section 3.4.4 page 83, section 3.5.6 page 89 ).

So, now you know why.

</long_answer>

Here is my question. There are a couple of ways to make the regression tests
not to fail because of multisampling.

1. Remove multisampling query: we will never get a multisample context, but
users may like to have antialiasing anyway.
2. Once we get a multisample context, call glDisable(GL_MULTISAMPLE) and never
use multisampling. We potentially get a context with a special buffer that
allocate some video memory for nothing, when this memory could be useful to
load a lot of textures.
3. Set default value of GlobalMaximumNumberOfMultiSamples to 0 instead of 8.
4. Set default value of MultiSamples to 0 instead of
   GlobalMaximumNumberOfMultiSamples.
5. On each potentially failing test, call SetMultiSamples(0) at the beginning,
which requires access to the concrete type of RenderWindow.

Solution 1 and 2 are really low level and limit application choice.

Solution 3 and 4 give more control to the application, but by default there
will be no antialiasing (no multisample-capable context) and it has to be set
by the application during the initialization of the render window.

Solution 5 looks easy for VTK tests, less easy for ParaView tests.

Any opinion about thoses solution, or some alternate solution is welcome.

This is an issue for Sandia as well, in fact our scripts set an environment variable __GL_FSAA_MODE=0 to work around this. The antialiasing creates 'seems' in the datasets where the compositing occurs.

Couldn't vtkTesting::RegressionTest() call SetMultiSamples(0) if
necessary before rendering? For ParaView, couldn't the same thing be
accomplished inside GUI/Testing/Tcl/Compare.tcl? I supposed that if a
test required MultiSamples turned on, it would have to explicitly
request it of vtkTesting or Compare, but I suspect this would be many
fewer tests than the other way around.

paraview does not have a tecplot reader. I believe Jean Favre wrote a
reader that reads some tecplot files, you might want to contact him.

paraview 2.2 support AMR but there has been bug fixes since.
Streamlines are not supported yet. I hope to fix that soon. Volume
rendering is not supported because it has not been implemented.
Whether it will be implemented or not depends on if we'll get the
funding to do so. Either way,  it is a few years in the future.

This is a known bug (well known by me :-) ) Some filters do not work
with AMR data structures yet. I am working on fixing this.

I don't think this is a good enough solution. The tests may pass but
all users will get anti-aliasing when running paraview interactively.
Compositing does not work propery when anti-aliasing is on. Also, it
will slow down rendering. We should disable anti-aliasing when we
create the render window in paraview.

 Antialiasing with multisampling method
Message-ID: <7137A9E1D1768C44BE7DF11D30FAB323D3167F@ES21SNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

In the past, I have added code to turn off antialiasing in ParaView when
running with parallel compositing.  I run all the time with the
IceTDesktopRenderModule and occasionally with IceTRenderModule.  The
compositing works fine there because the render modules explicitly turn
off multisampling.

Let me know if anyone is having multisampling problems so we can fix
that correctly.  It's a separate issue from regression testing.

Hmmm, it would be a bummer to lose anti-aliasing on single-node
rendering, though; it can really make a difference. Could we have just
the server renderwindows turn off anti-aliasing?

Subject: [Paraview] Time Parallelism + vtkFileCachePipeline + vtkNetCDFReader
Message-ID: <433575CB.70107@cscs.ch>

I've been working on parallelising vtkNetCDFReader for use in ParaView
and have some questions regarding pieces/pipelines and time variables.

I'm noticing that one individual dataset is generally not huge, but when
1600 time steps are present, the size of data is on the increase. The
reader currently manages extents using vtkExtentTranslator which does a
very nice job of partitioning the dataset into blocks and the data is
being split across processors nicely. However the reader will only reads
the current timeFrame and this seems like a terrible waste of resources,
when in fact 8 nodes could in fact read 100 time steps each and still
have room to spare.

Some time ago I put together a convenient filter called
vtkFileCachePipelineFilter which is a wrapper around a sub pipeline : to
save myself writing too much in this email, I've put a cuople of slides
(actually several almost duplicated ones) into here
ftp://ftp.cscs.ch/out/biddisco/vtk/vtkFileCachePipeline.ppt

The idea is very simple. Every time you run your program (eg demo of
something nice), you spend ages waiting for the reader/contour/glyph etc
etc to execute, and then you render it. In my code, I tend to save the
results to disk, put some #ifdef statements in to allow myself to
reexecute the pipleline if I want to regenerate the data (eg with new
parameters). I got fed up with this eventually (maintenance), and so
created a pipeline wrapper which caches the data (Terminology I use is,
shallow cache = on disk, deep cache=in memory). when you rerun the
program, the cache filter intercepts the pipeline update, checks the
disk and if the cache file is there, loads it in (and optionally keeps
it in memory). The file name can be set in the cache filter in a
sprintf(%) type way so that cache with param X is stored in one file, if
param Y is requested, it gets cached in another file etc etc. I've added
an option to use time variables as the param, so when running an
animation, the whole series of time data gets cached (memory permitting)
and it looks lovely from the user's viewpoint.The first time they run
it, the data gets loaded, but once the animation goes back to step zero,
it's all in memory and all is well.

Now in actual fact, the filter is extremely simple and does very little,
but now that I'm putting together the parallelism on the netCDF reader,
I see that there's an opportunity here to do something a bit nice and
combine the time variable caching and the parallel streaming into a
combined concept.

My initial thought is that the Heirarchical Dataset (the netDCF reader
is now a subclass of vtkHeirarchicalDatasetAlgorithm) could be populated
with N datasets (each representing a time step) and the one that is
passed downstream to the rest of the pipeline is selected from this by
the time step variable/parameter. I'd want to then use the animation
within paraview to stop through the data more rapidly than previously.
(Combining this with the caching ability so that downstream filters
could do contours/glyphs etc and have those results cached - would
actually be more useful in many cases thasn the raw data).

I'm told that others are working on similar ideas. If anyone has any
documents on this subject that I might be able to read, I'm going on
holiday in a couple of days and would welcome some extra material. In
particular, is there already a mechanism for splitting data across time
as well as spatial extents. etc etc.

Many thanks

JB

Subject: [Paraview] Very Small Coordinate Data
Message-ID: <BAY24-F646BB08E4DD81C7B7CA1687880@phx.gbl>

Please Help,

I have been using Paraview as a visualization tool now for about 6 months 
and think it is a great product but have ran into an issue I hope someone 
can help me with. I received a file that is not very large (322 nodes, 789 
Tetrahedral elements) but has very small coordinates (-0.440480985020E-13, 
0.3400809001E-01, etc). When I try and display the mesh I get nothing 
(doesn't crash - but does not show anything either).

I am using .xmf with a .h5 data file. Does Paraview work when the data 
values are very small and located very near each other such as this is the 
case? Should the values be re-scaled?

Attached is a copy of both the .xmf and .h5 file.

Thanks to anyone out there with some idea/hint.

I saw something like this ...
Here:
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2005-August/001857.html
and here:
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2005-August/001888.html

The solution was to update my cvs checkout and install from that. I have
only ever installed from cvs so I don't really know when the 2.2 branch
was, but I think it was before any of the gcc 4 stuff showed up.

I was also able to get things to compile by adding the headers gcc seems
to be complaining about.  This was just a hack from a non C++ guy
though.

We are reworking the EnSight reader and this is why probe is currently
disabled. It will be fixed before next release.

Please provide more information.  What version of ParaView are you 
running?  Are you trying to use the precompiled binaries, or did you 
build ParaView yourself?  (In order you run ParaView with a 
multi-process server, you must compile ParaView yourself; the 
precompiled binaries are not built with MPI, and so will not run in 
multiple processes.)  If you did build ParaView, did you tell the 
client the name of the first process in the server (using the 
--server-host or -sh command-line argument)?  Are you trying to have 
the client connect to the server (default behavior) or do you want 
the server to connect to the client?  (If you want the server to 
connect to the client, start the client first, and use the 
--reverse-connection or -rc command-line argument when starting both 
the client and the server.)  In what order did you start the client 
and the server?  (If the client is connecting to the server, start 
the server first.)

Hi Renato,

Not yet.

To add it, vtkTemporalProbeFilter.cxx will need to save "TheTime" into a 
new PointData array, and vtkPVProbe.cxx will need to add the name of the 
new array to the Array Selection widget.

I'll try it out when I can get back to the Probe.

Subject: [Paraview] Writing Unstructured Data in 2.2.1
Message-ID: <5F48ECE180E97337ED6E9E4A@localhost.localdomain>

None of the output formats will write unstructured data (from Threshold). 
Is this a bug?

Subject: [Paraview] Glyph Not Restored from Session Status in 2.2.1
Message-ID: <78955624DA5A588E3DD54A42@localhost.localdomain>

Upon loading a session status file Glyph could see no data - its variable 
selectors showed "None". Everything else looked fine and the input ot Glyph 
(the output from Threshold) looked good. Deleting Glyph and then adding it 
back, with exactly the same settings and input, worked. Is there a bug in 
Glyph or session save/load?

Subject: [Paraview] Threshold Changing Self in 2.2.1
Message-ID: <D386F316FC2A64E97697FECA@localhost.localdomain>

Threshold is changing its "Scalars" variable whenever the time step changes 
when the network has been loaded from a "session state" file. When the 
network is created from scratch it is fine.

The network:
   read (10 time steps of scalar and vector cell data from a series of .vtu 
files)
   Cut (plane)
   Centers (with "Generate vertices" on)
   Calc (create "mag of gas vel" from point data "gas velocity")
   Threshold ("Scalars" set to "mag of gas vel")

The output from Threshold looks correct for whichever value of "Scalars" it 
has decided to use. "Scalars" changes to another variable (the first 
scalar) whenever the reader's time step changes.

Thanks for any suggestions.
