Thanks for your help Samuel, Josu? and Chrsitan.
I can see my particles with vtu file with type cells 1 (point) if I 
start the cell number by 0.

Best regards,

Hi all,
I have a problem...I hade to write a new interactor style to move an abject (a cone) by another dataset. I want to create a this cone in the "display area" and then start my new interactor style and let move my cone... I can I do this?!
my biggest problem is to create this cone in the display area so  it can move (like a trasform filter) in another image previously  opened.
thanks in advance

Hello,

 

I'm quite a new user of paraview and I'm using it as a fluent
post-processor.

 

I'm loading transient data and doing animations of it. I would like to
have the text information of the time value appearing next to my model
representation during the animation.

 

I've understood that I can use some brackets [] to enter paraview vtk
commands in the annotation panel but I don't know what is the command to
write to have the time value to be displayed in the viewport window.

 

Please can somebody tell me how to do it?

 

Thank you

 

Luc

Hi,
I've got a nice transient dataset in paraview and I can see the live
time annotation in the scene right lower angle. Now I would like to use
this value in filters. Especially I'd like to ask whether there is a way
to access the current timestep value in the Calculator filter?
Thanks,

Message-ID: <43737DBC0A1DE3A8B87CB938@harpo.psc.edu>

Printing "currenttime" in the inner loop in vtkAnimationScene::Play shows a value of 0, 1, ..., 9 as expected (10 frames, sequence mode). However, when looping is on, the 2nd and subsequent loops start at 1 instead of 0.

If I have this right then data from the first time step would not be seen after the first pass when looping.

 Hi Christian

Thank you very much for your documentation, I was able
to run cave module. I have a cube display with four
walls, including floor. I am now using three of them:
two walls and a floor, the geometry displays on the
wall ok but not on the floor, do you have any idea how
to specify the coordinates for the floor?

Here is the coordinates for the two walls:

<Machine Name="prism_d2"
  Environment="DISPLAY=:0.0"
  LowerLeft="-1.0 0 -1.0"
  LowerRight="0 0 -1.0"
  UpperLeft="-1.0 1.0  -1.0" />

  <Machine Name="prism_d3"
  Environment="DISPLAY=:0.2"
  LowerLeft="0 0 -1 "
  LowerRight="1 0 -1 "
  UpperLeft="0 1 -1" />

Thank you in advance.

Greetings Luc,

Regarding getting a time stamp in your animation frames, I am familiar 
with three readers: pvd/vtk, EnSight, Exodus. Of theses three, only 
exodus will provide a time stamp for an animation (or snap-shoot).

I talked to the person who wrote the exodus-reader and he indicated it 
was rather complex to get the time info from the data structures within 
ParaView. I have attached a file that contains the script used by 
ParaView when processing an exodus database. You will note that it 
contains an exodus-specific function. So, I do not think it will be of 
any use except with an exodus database.

Your question is frequently asked -- I once ask it myself, and it will 
be asked again. It looks to me that your only option currently is to 
output your data using the exodus format: 
http://sourceforge.net/search/?type_of_search=soft&words=exodusii

It is not easy to write an exodus formatted file, but the exodus reader 
is in ParaView is quite good.

Regards,

Sam Key

Hi !

I didnt try this before  , ( i will soon) but i recommend try 
LowerRright (front) = Upperright(floor)
                            LowerLeft (floor)  = 0,0, 0  (front =
0,0,-1)        (z should be 0 in front ) 
                            LowerRight (floor) = 1 ,0,0

i m not shore but this should it , just give in the coordinates from a
cube.
tell me your results :-)

Thank you very much, Sam, for your answer. Unfortunately I'm using
Paraview for fluent post-pro which only export data as Ensight format.
So I think it will not be possible to have the time info printed next to
animations.

 

I 'll have a look at the link you send me concerning exodus and try to
see if it's possible to have a conversion tool to switch from Ensight to
Exodus.

 

Maybe I can do it with paraview ?? open Ensight and save as Exodus ??

 

I'll check all this... thanks again for your help

Hi all,

It's not the first time I see in the mailing list this question about 
time display.
I have the same need.

I use vtu files and I write the step time in each vtu file.
The reason I write the step time is to be able to restart a computation 
at the step time I want.

But If I can have a solution to see this step time in Paraview for me 
that would be an appreciated fonctionnality.

Best regards,

I want to ray cast (with vtkVolumeRayCastMapper) only a tile of the final

How can I use IceT library on a single machine? It's possible to do this

Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to use the time value in
the calculator filter. This would be  a very nice feature to add
though. I know that there are some very capable developers at CSCS :-)

Hi Mike,

I agree that it is an odd restriction. I am guessing that the wrappers
expect the vtk prefix. I am also guessing that there is no good reason
for them to do so. They need some work.

Hi Christian & Amy,
This is a segmented MRI image. I don't know much about MRI and dicom, I use 
these images to get the geometry to feed it to my numerical solver. Do you

So lets say for fun that I have my own file format that contains Time series
type of data. Can I write a paraview plugin so that Paraview will understand
the timesteps? Exodus does this? Where would I look in the Exodus code to
see what to implement.

Thanks

In-Reply-To: <454AF116.0548.0038.3@jku.at>

Hi,

I have tried your approach, but it didn't work :(.
After I    have tried long enough, I decided the cave
rander module is not going to work, it treats cave as
tiled display, if you look at your configure file, all
the walls have the same z value, if you change the z
value to a different value of a specific wall, that
wall will not work.    

For example, I have three walls,
 one for the center, one right wing and one floor.
if specify the coordinates like the following:

 Environment="DISPLAY=:0.0"
  LowerLeft="-1.0 0 -1.0"
  LowerRight="0 0 -1.0"
  UpperLeft="-1.0 1.0  -1.0" />   //center

  <Machine Name="prism_d3"
  Environment="DISPLAY=:0.2"
  LowerLeft="0 0 -1 "
  LowerRight="1 0 -1 "
  UpperLeft="0 1 -1" />   //right wing

  <Machine Name="prism_d4"
  Environment="DISPLAY=:0.3"
  LowerLeft="-1 -1 -1 "
  LowerRight="0  -1 -1 "
  UpperLeft="-1 0 -1" />  //floor



you will see the left upper part of the geometry on
the  center wall, right upper part on the right wing
and left bottom part on the floor. But we want the
floor have the whole bottom part, we can have the
whole bottom part by specifying the coordinates
differently, but the bottom part will not align with
the upper part.

If you have any new findings, pleas let me know.

Thanks,

Yi

Hello !

MMMHH you are right. How does it non work. try 2 walls 1 front one
floor  . and watch the results, i'm sure ??? (not really) that the error
is in the cave coordinates.
During my tests i try to adjust the z coordinates also and the reulst
was also erorr (not displaying )
Another thing is maybe you didnt adjust the object.

Subject: [Paraview] PLOT3D Files for paraview.
Message-ID: <1162856206.454fc70e566b4@webmail.stanford.edu>



Hi,

I have PLOT3D geometry and function files that I want to read into Paraview.
I understand that Paraview does not support reading function files
currently. I have modified the code for vtkMultiBlockPLOT3DReader.cxx to
include this functionality. I also modified the
GUI/Client/Resources/Reader.xml to include another box for taking the name
of Function file as input. However, I am unable to find other places where
I need to make changes in order to read in the file correctly.

Could you help me out with this. Is there some documentation on how to
change code/Paraview functionality, I mean some steps listed for changes to
files that use the VTK files underneath.

Thanks a lot.
Shradha

Subject: [Paraview] Glyphing of a Group of Groups does not work.
Message-ID: <d3d4ab920611070909h72c7df02r4abf6fd596f07f5a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have tried to apply Glyph to an output of the GroupDataSets filter.
The input for the GroupDataSets filter is also a vtkMultiGroupDataSet.
The Glyph then produce no output.

To reproduce this behaviour, try simply:
SphereSource->GroupDataSets->GroupDataSets->Glyph

I have spend some time examining the problem. In my opinion, the cause
is at  vtkPVGlyphFilter.cxx (line 327, revision 1.26). The Glyph
filter can handle vtkDataSet only as an element of the
vtkMultiGroupDataSet.

I understand, it is a reasonable assumption (to have multigroup data
set composed from data sets only). However, other filters I have tried
have no problems with such composed data sets. It would be a pity to
have this limitation for a certain group of filters ...

Is there a chance this will be fixed in a near future?

Thank you,
Milan.

IceT works fine for compositing only a single tile.  In fact, this is
the default mode when starting ParaView in client/server with desktop
delivery.

 

The real issue is the volume mappers that ParaView gives access to.
Right now, ParaView only gives access to the unstructured grid volume
mappers.  Structured volume rendering is going to be added before the
release of ParaView 2.6, but I have been told for that release ParaView
will only support vtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper.

 

It is also possible to use VTK+IceT without ParaView, but tricky.

Hi all,
I want to ray cast (with vtkVolumeRayCastMapper) only a tile of the
final image, with no computation of the rest of the image, in a normal
screen (not Tiled-display).
How can I use IceT library on a single machine? It's possible to do this
with vtk+IceT without Paraview?

What's missing? Is there a fix?

I have the following setup:

Subject: [Paraview] Exposing Timesteps in a Custom File Format
Message-ID: <C1779133.9DD5%mike.jackson@imts.us>

I am developing a ParaView reader for my custom file format. Inside our data
we have the data laid by timesteps. I was wanting to use this information
inside of ParaView so I am basically copying the Exodus Reader (at least the
timestep portion). So far everything is ok except that the following line of
code comes back false:

  if(outInfo->Has(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_INDEX()))

It is with in this block that the time value and the index get updated but
for some reason when run in my code this comes back false. I am currently
running the reader using a command line "test" program and have not actually
tried it in ParaView for some other reasons. Is there a special type of
pipeline I need to instantiate in a non-ParaView setting? Is there something
is the xml files that needs to be set so the UPDATE_TIME_INDEX key is
present? How about in the header file for my class? Maybe some undocumented
accessor method?

Any help would be appreciated.

Hi Mike,

First a disclaimer: the time support in VTK and ParaView is evolving.

Currently, the only way to set the time on a reader in ParaView is
though a set/get method pair on the public API. Exodus does this by
providing SetTimeStep and GetTimeStep methods. To add the time
support on the GUI, readers.xml and Readers.xml files have to updated.

In VTK, a time aware pipeline can send UPDATE_TIME_INDEX() to request
a specific time step instead of using the public methods. This is not
yet supported in paraview. It is however on our roadmap.

A reader tells the pipeline (and paraview) which time steps are
available by setting TIME_STEPS() key on the output information during
RequestInformation(). This is also what is used to automatically display
the current time value as annotation.

Also, there has been some recent changes to the time support in VTK.
UPDATE_TIME_INDEX() is no longer used. UPDATE_TIME_STEPS() is used
instead. This is not index based. It contains the time values that the
pipeline is requesting. It is up to the reader to find the closest time
step or even interpolate if desired. For more information, look here:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Time_Support

I hope that there will be an article on this in the next Kitware Source.

Thanks for the info.. I managed to get parts of my reader working but I am
having trouble getting some others working.

The Range for Timesteps that show up in ParaView is always 0 to 100. I have
500 in my file. I have the public set/get methods for TimeStepRange. Is
there somewhere else that I should have some accessors? Looking through the
Exodus Reader is not really yielding anything.

I can post my xml files if needed.. I am sure I am just missing something
simple.

Also, when I get a pointer to the vtkUnstructuredGrid from the OUtputVector
in RequestData method there seems to be something fishy about using that
Object as it causes an EXEC_BAD_ACCESS when trying to add a new cell to it.
Is there some sort of initialization that I need to be doing? I do create my
own vtkPoints object and set that into the vtkUnstructuredGrid? Is that a
problem? Should I be using the vtkPOints from the grid?

Thanks for the help.

OK. I figured out the second question.. I just did a
outputVector->ShallowCopy(...) and that seems to work.

My first question is still out there though.. What I have figured out is
that if I "animate" then the slider is properly updated with the values that
it should have. Although it now moves in increments of 5 instead of 1..
Which makes sense as I have 500 timesteps, and this is a Scale widget.. Have
to dig deeper to see how the Exodus reader is getting away with this.

Any help is still appreciated.

Shradha,

Perhaps it will help if you look at the link below :

	http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend


I add an external module to read plot3D function files, I follow the 
explanations in the link  and it works . I think that you had to write (or 
modify in your case) a servermanager xml file, you'll find the model in 
Server/ServerManager/Resources/reader.xml.

This is the worst argument I've ever seen... how disgusting... :-(

It baffles me that people are still trying to sell software for big  
dollars, when open source
stuff is always going to be right on their heels and free.

Surely it is obvious that the modern way to run a software business  
for non turnkey applications
(ie not games, and some industrial applications)
is to sell books/detailed docs/install CDs, Tshirts etc,
  and most importantly sell knowledge and experience in the form of  
consultation.
Open source software like VTK is great,
but even better is talking to someone who knows it inside out.

I'd rather our lab paid 10000 dollars for a couple of months of  
expert input in to software development
than buy a single license for proprietary software that only does  
half the stuff you want.

The old business model is dead, because of how easy it now is for any  
kid with a computer
and some programming skills to knock out pretty good functional GUI  
software in a couple of months,
with the help of existing open source tools like python and VTK.

I dont know why these companies dont just go open source and help  
themselves and everyone else.

Same things are happening in the biomedical imaging field.
A few companies are trying to squeeze big cash out of publicly funded  
research labs
for single user licenses. I know they dont sell that many of them as  
they are far too expensive.
Why not work together on the software development, and then use their  
vast expertise in imaging,
image analysis and 3D graphics to actually go help researchers  
achieve their scientific goals
as consultants and charge for that. Then the researchers really are  
getting something for their money.

just my 2 cents (no pun intended)

Message-ID: <52360f190611102346qd97b8c4v34b5f5cb3c764b51@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!
I have to create an animation(movie) from turbulent flow dataset urgently! I
would really appreciate your help.
I have a VTK_RECTILINEAR_GRID turbulent fluid flow dataset with velocity
(vector) and pressure (scalar). I want to create vorticity isosurfaces. I
know vorticity is curl of velocity vector, i.e. del 'cross product' V, where
del is vector gradient operator and V is velocity vector. How do I calculate
vorticity from velocity in paraview? I searched a lot in filters, however,
could not find a vector gradient operator. The gradient filter of paraview
finds imageGradient and not vector gradient. When I applied calc and got a
component of velocity (which should supposedly be treated as scalar), even
then gradient was not enabled as an applicable filter.
Thanks in advance for your help.
Aditya

Hi Berk,
 
It doesn't seem to be working yet (at least to solve this specific problem).
I checked out the PV HEAD today (11th saturday) and compiled with VS2003 (I
gave up to use VS2005, but it's another history). My problem is that I'd
like to compare the volume preservation in a Zalesak's rotation disk
problem. This volume itself is not so hard to compute but, actually, I'm
questioning the results obtained from the routine I wrote. In this way I'd
like to load my data in PV, clip the data using an scalar value greater a
value (0.5 in my case) and compute the volume of the clipped data. The
following screen http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/PV-screen.JPG
gives you an idea of the problem.

is it possible to do?! What am I missing?

p.s.: I also tried with the PV3 november's snapshot. Now the Ensight reader
seems to be working correctly to load steady state data but the clip filter
in PV3 does not have all features available in 2.4.x PV versions yet.

Regards

Renato.

Do you dispute the facts that Kent Misegades lays out?

1. ParaView was funded by DoE and DoD labs.  That is an incontrovertible
fact.  When you launch ParaView, you see the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
Sandia National Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and
U.S. Army Research Laboratory logos on the splash page.  In case you miss
it, you can always find it under Help-->About.
2. The national laboratories are funded by U.S. taxpayers.  Again, this is
an incontrovertible fact.
3. ParaView is given away freely.  Again, this is an incontrovertible fact.

Do you think that ParaView would be in as good a shape IF the U.S. taxpayer
did not fund it via the DoE and DoD?

My point is this:
1. Kitware received U.S. taxpayer money via the DoD and DoE to make it the
product it is.
2. Open-Source is not a panacea.  Paying someone good money to develop a
good product is still the best way to make good software.
3. EnSight is still a great product and can do things that ParaView cannot
do.
4. ParaView is still a great product and can do things that EnSight cannot
do.

I view ParaView and EnSight as tools in the toolbox.  I use whichever one
will best solve the current problem I have.  Sometimes the answer is that
neither one will solve the problem so I have to write my own code.

I am glad you got it to work. A word of caution: that is a new
feature. I would verify the integration results before trusting them
100%.

I think the real cause for complaint here is his comparison of using Open
source Software to funding Terrorism by taking money out of US corporation's
pockets.  Just like Ensight, ParaView/Kitware has accepted funds from
Private Industry & the Government to develop the product they have today.

And I would argue with your point #2... I often find open-source software
far superior to "paid" systems :)

Well, this discussion could last forever...
 
I wouldn't like to "dispute the facts" that Kent has written on that forum.
In fact, I was too far putting my opinions there... I understand that those
facts are incontrovertible as you said. I only got astonished by the
attitude itself. I'd never imagine someone making such arguments, being them
reasonable or not, in a public forum. It's not noble to inflame US citizens
against an open source public funded project. This kind of behaviour is not
for a company's president and we have some reservation if this guys is
really who he's saying.
 
By the way, I don't have any right to discuss what north americans do with
their taxes. I'm a Brazilian (a south american) who already have a huge tax
load to pay (each Brazilian works 4 months per year just to pay taxes). In
my case, I'm only concerned if my government has been giving a good destiny
to our money or not (unfortunately, our government has too much to learn
yet). Moreover, I'm not worried if my money is being applied in an open
source project or not. BTW, I'm almost sure that our research funds do not
have any restriction against giving away softwares or whatever public
funded. If so, I'd like to know the excuses behind the restriction,
otherwise, If the project is really public and will bring good results, for
me or anyone else within my country or not -- *help any people around the
world* -- it's more than enough (IMHO).
 
Going further, how many US citizens work in a Linux platform nowadays?! Did
anybody (from US, Brazil, China, Iraq, Angola, wherever) give any cent to
Linus Torvald?! I don't think so and we could imagine what would have
happened if Finland had funds restriction like some NASA projects have
(restricted only to US citizens).
 
Maybe the Kent's message could make us think how wrong and old some business
model are. We know that people have been making good money with open source
projects. They sell support, books, T-shirts, especific software
development, etc..., etc..., etc... they put more value in their knowledge
than in their products itself and it's also incontrovertible. CEI should
think about it. They could start change their business model a little.
 
>>> Do you think that ParaView would be in as good a shape IF the U.S.
taxpayer did not fund it via the DoE and DoD? <<<
 
Who knows?! I think that the main fact which makes open source projects
boost their grow is the model of sharing knowledge among different people
with different experience, inside or outside the main development team.
Furthermore, I'm sure there's a large number of open source projects in a
good shape without relying only in government funds...
 
Respectfully 
 
Renato

Do you dispute the facts that Kent Misegades lays out?

1. ParaView was funded by DoE and DoD labs.  That is an incontrovertible
fact.  When you launch ParaView, you see the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
Sandia National Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and
U.S. Army Research Laboratory logos on the splash page.  In case you miss
it, you can always find it under Help-->About.
2. The national laboratories are funded by U.S. taxpayers.  Again, this is
an incontrovertible fact. 
3. ParaView is given away freely.  Again, this is an incontrovertible fact.

Do you think that ParaView would be in as good a shape IF the U.S. taxpayer
did not fund it via the DoE and DoD?  

My point is this: 
1. Kitware received U.S. taxpayer money via the DoD and DoE to make it the
product it is.
2. Open-Source is not a panacea.  Paying someone good money to develop a
good product is still the best way to make good software. 
3. EnSight is still a great product and can do things that ParaView cannot
do.  
4. ParaView is still a great product and can do things that EnSight cannot
do.  

I view ParaView and EnSight as tools in the toolbox.  I use whichever one
will best solve the current problem I have.  Sometimes the answer is that
neither one will solve the problem so I have to write my own code.

>>> I would verify the integration results before trusting them 100%. <<<

I see... if it helps you in anything I'm sending some "benchmark" results.

The disk has diameter 30 and height 0.5. The slot has width 5, length 25 and
height .5, thus:

V_cylinder = H x (pi*D^2)/4 = 353.429

V_slot = W x L x H = 5 x 25 x .5 = 62.5

V_disk = V_cylinder - V_slot = 290.929

I tested the integration attributed filter computing the volume from the
clip and the threshold filters. As you can see by the images

http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/clip.jpg

http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/threshold.JPG

the clip data resulted the volume 227.874 (not so good) while the threshold
produced the volume 290.919 (almost perfect!).

Can you figure out why the results were different if the datasets are quite
similar?

Regards

Renato.

p.s.: Other useful parameters:
The clip filter grouped 4033 cells, 1494 points and polygon count 4033
The Threshold filter grouped 4037 cells, 1494 points and polygon count 4037
4 tets giving a difference of 63.045?! These tets have 0.5 of height at
most.

I had to do the same thing a few months ago, and Renato Elias pointed  
out that the ParaView Wiki has instructions for adding the  
vtkCellDerivatives filter to the ParaView menu: http:// 
www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend

After you follow those instructions, you should be able choose that  
filter from the Filters menu. It takes point data and returns cell  
data. (You'll need to convert back to point data for isosurfaces.)  
You can get the vorticity vectors from it and then use the Calculator  
filter to compute mag(Vorticity).  You can also get the individual  
partial derivatives from tensor it returns, which is nice. For  
example, you can use it to compute divergence by applying the  
Calculator filter and telling it to compute Tensors_0+Tensors_4 
+Tensors_8.

The vtkCellDerivatives filter has a memory-allocation bug that  
requires you to have a scalar field as well as a vector field for the  
vorticity calculation to work (I filed a bug on it: http:// 
www.vtk.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=4019&pos=13 ). You can get  
around this by moving the outVectors allocation code (line 77-93) in  
<paraview_source>/VTK/Graphics/vtkCellDerivatives.cxx to line 103,  
next to the allocation of outTensors. I'm not sure if this the best  
way to fix it, but it works well enough if you just want to compute  
the vorticity or divergence of a velocity vector field by itself,  
which is what I was trying to do at the time.

Hi!
I need help here.
I have around 200 time series of turbulent flow dataset, each in a separate
legacy vtk file. Each one has velocity(vector) and pressure (scalar). I have
already applied filters on one of the files to create a wonderful velocity
streamline around vorticity isosurfaces. I tried to animate the series of
filters on the complete time series. However, it didn't work out. I added
all files in timeseries. Then I selected Tracks -> property as filename and
added each file as a separate keyframe. Let me know if I am doing something
wrong in this or if I missed something. I have read tutorials on
http://www.psc.edu/general/software/packages/paraview/tutorial/pvt.php?s=5
and http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:AnimationTutorial and several
others. However, most of them miss on creating animation from timeseries
data when each snapshot is in a different vtk file. Please help me. I have
to submit this animation urgently.
Thanks in advance.

The way I have done this recently is the following:

Name all the files so that they are increasing in numerical order such as:

Time-001.vtk
Time-002.vtk
....
Time-200.vtk

Then in ParaView, open the First TimeStep.. ParaView automagically figures
out that the file is some sort of timeseries. When you click on the "Play"
button in the Animation toolbar then ParaView will step through each file.

This seems to work for me.. Maybe it is completely accidental?

Subject: [Paraview] Compile Errors with ParaView and my own Modules
Message-ID: <C17CA040.A141%mike.jackson@imts.us>

I am trying to have my own libraries compiled into ParaView but I am getting
an error that I think is related to the XML files.

 I know that everything works as a separate library because I can compile up
everything, launch ParaView, select "Import Package", select my package xml
file and then load my data.

I followed the instructions in the ParaView Book to create the
XXXParaViewImport.cmake file. I then went through ccmake and setup
everything in there and then stated compiling.

Here is the error:

-- Generate module: rendering
-- Generate module: writers
Cannot extract module name from the file:
/Users/mjackson/Projects/Task_4/PVDislocationModules/PVDislocationModules.pv
sm
make[2]: *** [Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMGeneratedModules.h] Error 1
make[1]: *** [Servers/ServerManager/CMakeFiles/vtkPVServerManager.dir/all]
Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2


This is on OS X (10.4.8) with the latest Dev Tools (Xcode 2.4.1) although I
am using a Make project and Xcode has nothing to do with this compile.

Here is my PVDislocationModulesParaViewImport.cmake file
--------------------------
# specify the name of the module
SET(MODULE_NAME PVDislocationModules)

# Specify non wrapped sources
SET (PVDislocationModules_SRCS
    "${PVDislocationModules_SOURCE_DIR}/vtkDislReaderLE.cxx"
)

# specify the sources that should be wrapped
SET(PVDislocationModules_WRAPPED_SRCS
    "${PVDislocationModules_SOURCE_DIR}/vtkFCCGlidePlaneFilter.cxx"
    "${PVDislocationModules_SOURCE_DIR}/vtkBurgerVectorFilter.cxx"
    "${PVDislocationModules_SOURCE_DIR}/vtkParadisReader.cxx"
)

#-- Set any include Directories this module needs

/${MODULE_NAME}.pvsm")

PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_GUI_RESOURCES("${PVDislocationModules_SOURCE_DIR}/${MODULE_
NAME}.XML")
---------------------------------------------

Here is the first part from my GUI XML file
-------------------------
<ModuleInterface>
 <Library name="PVDislocationModules"
directory="/Users/Shared/OpenSource/pvbuild/bin"/>
 <ServerManagerFile name="PVDislocationModules.pvsm"/>
-------------------------------------------------

And in the same folder is the PVDislocationModules.pvsm File.  Is there
something wrong with my XML files?

I can post my ParaView CMakeCache.txt if needed.

Thanks for any help

Well I got ParaView to compile by switching the XML files around. So now
when I launch ParaView I get the following Error:

I compiled in Debug Mode and turned on debug in all my vtkObject derived
classes. 

505:[mjackson@Thor:..enSource/pvbuild/bin]$ ./paraview
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
  what():  basic_string::_S_construct NULL not valid
Abort trap

I also compiled without my modules and ParaView compiles and runs just fine.
Is there something different about compiling the modules into ParaView
versus using the "Import Package" from ParaView itself?

You might try the attached *.pvd file as an example of a method to tell 
PV 2.4.4 (won't work in older versions) you have time series data. The 
animation  capability should work. (name="..." is an as-yet undocumented 
feature that conveys part names to the Extract Groups filter's face sheet)

Hey Sam,
Can you please send me the file directly to my email. I think the mailing
list scrubbed it. I guess it's only a small file which lists all timeseries
as a collection in xml format.
I read your messages an year back abt similar problem u faced, were they
solved?
Thanks
Adi

Each of my files is one timestep. I trimmed down .pvd file to include only
filename and timestep. When I loaded the file in paraview (by open Data),
paraview crashed! :-(
My files are data_UVWP.72.vtk to data_UVWP.236.vtk. I have pasted my .pvd
file. What should I put in part and name tag, if I must, so that paraview
does not crash. I am trying different combinations, till now with no
success. Do I need to select .pvd from 'Open Data' or 'import package'?
Let me know your comments, they're invaluable to me!
thnx
Adi

tag in your pvd file:-->
    <DataSet timestep="0001" part="001" file="fmavto.m001.t001.vtu"
name="Asmb:FRAME Part:FRONT Matl:ALUMINUM"/>

My .pvd file:-->

This is caused by a "bug" (feature) in vtkAnimationScene. I have fixed 
this in my local tree, but due to lack of time to add some other 
improvements I was working on, I never committed it. (In fact the fix I 
made was for raw vtk looping, but I suspect that what you see is a 
manifestation of this in paraview).

I I send you a patch, can you test it in paraview and if it works ok and 
doesn't break anything else, I'll commit it. yes?

Sounds good to me. Can you coordinate with Utkarsh? He is the original
author of the animation code.

Should the parallel part of VTK 4.4 work if I link it with MPICH2?  (See

Thanks.

Wasn't there some limitation in having more than 100 files?

Hi!
I am trying to create an animation out of 164 legacy vtk files, each one a
timestep. Is there a limitation of 100 timesteps or something? I am manually
entering each timestep as a keyframe. Is there a way by which paraview picks
all files as timesteps to create an animation?
Thanks

But I think that the build didn't go smoothly with mpich2 and vtk 4.4, I 
suspect vtk 5 is necessary for mpich2 - something to do with 
IGNORE_CXX_SEEK or something similar.

Hi!
Does anybody know about this limitation of 100 files. My files are all
legacy vtk files, in total 164. Moreover, is there a way paraview picks all
files as timeseries? Mike, were your files legacy VTK or new xml formats?

What I ran into was that ParaView by default seems to use 100 Frames for its
animation. If you show the "Key Frame Animation" and manually set the number
of key frames to the number of Timesteps then you should have better luck. I
have a set of data that has 533  timesteps and I was able to view all
timesteps using this "trick".

After working with Andy last night it would seem that there is a serious bug
with the ParaView 2.4.4 Release. If I use the Latest CVS and comment out
some of the XML then I can get a combined compile of my code and ParaView.

  I think a new release of ParaView may be coming so I am not holding out
hope of a fix in the 2.4.4 branch.

OK.. Check that last email.. After Kent Eschenberg let me take a look at a
working project I finally figured out what I was doing wrong.

I had the name of the Server Manager file ending in ".pvsm" which is a no
no. It _must_ end with ".xml" which in hindsight makes complete sense
because it _is_ an xml file. But to have a compile fail solely based on the
file extension and NOT the actual content of the file is a bit restrictive.

Regardless I now have a working project and combined ParaView build.

Thanks to those who contributed time and effort to helping me out.

You may enjoy watching a presentation that uses ParaView at this year's 
Supercomputing Conference.

A simulation of blood flow, running on a parallel system in Pittsburgh, 
will use a PSC package named PDIO to write files directly to a workstation 
at the show. A modified version of ParaView on that workstation will 
animate the data, adding new datasets as they arrive.

ParaView will be running in serial mode but the data is stored in parallel 
from one end to the other (pvd and vtu files). This eliminates the need for 
conversion or combining parallel outputs into a single file.

The presentation will run from 11:00am to 11:30am on Wednesday and Thursday 
at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center booth. The developers of the flow 
simulation and PDIO will describe their work and answer questions.

my real problem is that I didn't write my <moduleName>ParaViewImport.cmake file in a right way.
I follow the istruction of the paraview user guide, of the site (Paraview:Extend) but It doesn't work the "import".
Unfortunally I didn't sand you my source. my project files are five: 2 file .cpp and 3 file .h
How can I write my <moduleName>ParaViewImport.cmake file?

thank you very much for the help

Subject: [Paraview] Opening PVD Files Referencing Thousands of Files
Message-ID: <E3A7FF62CE93A7EE2DC32ADB@localhost.localdomain>

If one has a parallel application using 512 processors to generate 100 time 
steps it seems like a good idea to use the pvd file format where each 
processor can write one file per time step. This creates 51,201 files.

When the pvd file is opened it seems that ParaView tries to read all of the 
files and generate output (from vtkPVDReader) that includes the contents of 
every file. As you might guess, this takes a very long time. Is this an 
error or was the pvd format not designed for so many files?

I've altered our version to temporarily add the "restriction" that the 
timestep must be 0 when the reader sees that there are no other 
restrictions. As a result, when the file is first opened, it generates 
output from only timestep 0. Later, as one animates through the time steps, 
the animator adds a restriction for just the needed time.

Does that fix make senses in general? What have been the experience of 
others with transient data stored in thousands of files?

TIA

I've had the same trouble with the XMLCollectionReader. When accessing
hundreds of time steps, it creates an internal reader for each step,
then on the very first pass, it tries to update information (memory may
cause a mistake here) on them all, and it suffers greatly.

I made a similar adjustment to the code to prevent it doing this, but I
suspect the class needs a fairly serious redesign. I wanted to interface
the XML pvd datasets to a Temporal Pipeline using the new
vtkTemporalDataSet and I got it working, but with much pain (and
hair/sleep loss etc)

Subject: [Paraview] offscreen display trouble revisited
Message-ID: <455C6DB9.2020906@cscs.ch>

I keep getting a warning that one or more of the servers cannot access a 
display and so compositing will be disabled.
I've used
OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR               
/workspace/biddisco/cmakebuild/gcc3/Mesa-6.4.2/include
 OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY

 OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY

OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR               
/workspace/biddisco/cmakebuild/gcc3/Mesa-6.4.2/include
 OSMESA_LIBRARY                   
/workspace/biddisco/cmakebuild/gcc3/Mesa-6.4.2/lib/libOSMesa.so

VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA ON
VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN ON
(also VTK_USE_DISPLAY OFF)

and set environment to (also tried blank for DISPLAY)
DISPLAY :0

the binary links against the correct mesa gl and osmesa etc (see below 
for ldd)

It used to work ok, but I must have broken something. Anyone got any idea?

thanks

1) Another possible cause is that something changed in your OS' defaults. Upgrades to some of our systems sometimes replaces various graphics header files.

2) You might try changing

to instead set DISPLAY to localhost:0.0.

3) Using X Windows and using OpenGL are two different issues; linking t Mesa does not always eliminate the need to access X.

For example, the code may ask X for a font definition that it uses to prepare the equivalent font in Mesa.

There is also a bug (may not be on the formal list) where pvbatch (and maybe pvserver) still need to see an X server though they don't really use it.

4) Finally, keep in mind that there are 2 different types of "off screen rendering".

The one that is officially known by that name has been in OpenGL from the beginning (see glXCreateGLXPixmap). It writes to an X pixmap instead of the screen (I suspect there is also a Windows version). I *think* this approach still uses the graphics card
for acceleration.

In addition, Mesa can render off screen, into a buffer, and does not need a graphics card or an X pixmap - it tries to hide all that from the application.

Of course, all this is just a list of options; perhaps someone who knows the internals can comment on how VTK/ParaView actually does things???

Hi,

Assuming you use cvs version of ParaView, there was some change related to offscreen rendering in VTK on October 26. Is it when the warnings started to occur?

Under X11, if vtk was compiled with OSMESA (OS=OffScreen) it creates an OSMesa window and an OSMesa context.
Otherwise, (NEW) it tries to use a hardware accelerated offscreen rendering by creating a window and an OpenGL context and asking for OpenGL extensions GL_EXT_framebuffer_object and GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two.
It those extensions are not available, the OpenGL context and window are destroyed and it tries to use a Pbuffer offscreen. If not available, it uses a GLX Pixmap.

Under Win32, it first tries the hardware accelerated offscreen rendering (NEW). If the extensions are not available, an Offscreen Device Context is used.

The source code is in VTK/Rendering: vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow, vtkWin32OpenGLRenderWindow and the superclass vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.

Francois

vtk is compiled with OSMesa, I was using a cvs version around the end 
octobers - I just did a cvs update and clean build and the same problem 
exists. However, I believe I had problems /before /26 oct. I originally 
attributed my trouble to using pvserver from pv3 and pvclient from pv2, 
but I'm not doing that any more - it was working in early oct, but I 
don't know exactly when I broke it.

I tried various DISPLAY localhost:0.0 and :0 combinations, with and 
without xservers available, but always the same trouble.

(The machines are headless, so offscreen rendering must be software)

Anything else I can try?

I don't know if this will help at all... but, here goes:

In your original email you said you have VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN on but
VTK_USE_DISPLAY off.

VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN is simply used to control the *default* value of
vtkRenderWindow's OffScreenRendering property. VTK_USE_DISPLAY controls what
VTK tests are run: tests that require the display (whether offscreen
rendered or not) are skipped if VTK_USE_DISPLAY is off.

So, it probably makes no difference to your particular case, here, but in my
mind, it doesn't make a lot of sense to set VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN to ON unlesss
VTK_USE_DISPLAY is also ON. "OffScreen" rendering occurs invisibly, but it
still requires use of the display...

Now this is all strictly from the VTK side of the fence. Don't know if these
settings propagate to any other logical implications on the ParaView side of
the fence.


HTH,
David

setting VTK_USE_DISPLAY to yes, didn't make any differnce (though most 
of vtk rebuilt itself!)

If I start a single pvserver on the headless machine and connect to it 
it does this
1) if I allow ssh X forwarding (undesired) it opens up a window and 
renders on it (slow), but the client correctly displays it
2) if I ensure DISPLAY is localhost:0 I get an error about no display 
available (ie offscreen impossible).

It seems that the VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN is being ignored

Just to set my mind at rest...

On the headless server which has paraview compiled with Mesa and 
offscreen=yes. The display is set to localhost:0

what should happen when you type 'xterm'?
xterm Xt error: Can't open display: localhost:0

Subject: [Paraview] read starcd ensight mesh
Message-ID: <20061118191208.GA5281@ddorf.de>

Hi,

sorry, but I want to ask again, if anybody has used paraview
together with starccm+ or starcd version 4.00 or 3.26.
Now, I got paraview 2.4.4 installed in my office on an 64bit
machine.  I
tried to load polyhedra results from starccm+ and starcd
version 4.00. This time it does not crash, but nothing
happens; I just see the variables. I tried to change the
export to binary, but I got the same result. Later on I used
a tetra mesh from the old version with the same result.

I wonder, if nobody uses starcd together with paraview and
has the same problems like I do!? I am the first at our
company, so I hope that there will be more of us in the next
months, but for that it has to work with starcd...

Would be nice to get any hint!
Greetings!
Fabian

Hi Fabian,

Which file format are you using? Legacy VTK? It should work with the
tetra mesh. I will not work with the polyhedra mesh unfortunately. VTK
(hence ParaView) does not currently support polyhedral cells. Although
starccm+ visualization engine is built on top of VTK, they developed
the polyhedra support independently and are keeping it proprietary. I
hope that in the future we will have the opportunity to add polyhedra
support to VTK.

Hi Berk,

thanks for your help. I exported the data in ensight format.
I did not know that I can export in any vtk format!? The
strange thing is that even with the old starcd 3.26 version
the ensight exported tetra mesh makes the same problem. I'll
try to convert it to a vtk format using python-vtk. Maybe
that helps.
Does anybody work on polyhedra support for vtk right now?
Would be nice :-)

Thanks and Greetings!
Fabian

Hello Fabian,

I have a patch for ParaView/VTK allowing you to read EnSight gold files
with polyhedra. You can find the patch (for ParaView's CVS for version
2.5 as of March 3, 2006) at the following URL:
http://yvan.fournier.free.fr/paraview/nfaced/

To apply the patch on a current CVS version, overwrite the EnSight
reader files in ParaView's src/VTK/IO directory with the ones from
the patch, modify the CVS/Entries file in the same subdirectory
so that the following versions are given:

vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader.cxx/1.64/ 
vtkEnSightGoldReader.cxx/1.56/ 
vtkEnSightGoldReader.h/1.20/ 
vtkEnSightReader.cxx/1.61/ 
vtkEnSightReader.h/1.27

then update your CVS directory (to merge changes to those files)
These files have changed little over time (yesterday's versions
were at vtkEnSightReader.cxx/1.63/ and vtkEnSightReader.h/1.28,
others were unchanged), and I can send you updated versions if
you prefer. In any case, you will need to recompile ParaView
(or parts of it at least).

This patch is also entered in ParaView's bug tracker as Bug #2971.
Polyhedra are converted to VTK_CONVEX_POINT_SET, which may not
be the best way to do things, but at least works.

For your info, I ran a 480,000 cell mesh generated by Comet Design
(a precursor of the meshing tools in Star CCM+ I believe, and
in any case a CD-Adapco product from 2-3 years ago) through
our CFD code's pre-processor, generating EnSight Gold files.
EnSight read it quite easily, while ParaView seemed to split it
into 12 million or so tetrahedra, leading to memory consumption
close to 2 Gb and making further operations impossible on a
32-bit machine, but it worked, and works fine for smaller cases
(except for artifacts at junctions between "classical" and
"polyhedral" elements appearing as false boundaries (which
dissapear when the tetralization filter is applied to the whole
set, and should not be an issue with data from Star-CD or Star-CCM+,
which is purely polyhedral (as far as I know).

Good luck !

Hi, all

I have compiled and installed PV2.4.4 with MPI on a small cluster with 4 nodes.
OS is Rathat Linux 9.0. Compiler is GCC.

When I use it to process .vts files (ascii), I found a problem:
if there are float values less than 1.0e-31 like x.xxxe-32 or x.xxxe-35 and so on (see the following example),
the PV stoped and printed an read error. 
While in windows OS, everything is normal.

Is this a bug in PV for Linux OS? 
Any help is welcome. 

PS: a data example

Subject: [Paraview] Some D3 and MPI questions
Message-ID: <45616829.80403@cscs.ch>

Part 1 : D3

I'd like to add the DistributedDataFilter into one of our readers. It 
cannot necessarily partition the data well at read time due to the 
format of the data so having the readers do the distribution using D3 is 
my best bet.
When the TimeStep changes, the geometry changes. I'd like to use the

"// Enhancement: You can set the k-d tree decomposition, rather than
// have D3 compute it.  This allows you to divide a dataset using
// the decomposition computed for another dataset.  Obtain a description
// of the k-d tree cuts this way:"

Capability, to generate the BSP tree when the first time step is loaded, 
and then re-use it when successive steps are loaded. However, I'm 
slightly uncertain about one (actually more) thing.
It goes on to say
"  //    When this filter executes, it creates a vtkPKdTree (K-d tree)
  //    data structure in parallel which divides the total distributed
  //    data set into spatial regions.  The K-d tree object also creates
  //    tables describing which processes have data for which
  //    regions.  Only then does this filter redistribute
  //    the data according to the region assignment scheme."

Now as each time step is produced, one part of the mesh is rotating, it 
occupies the same space, so the BSP partition should be fine (providing 
some small tolerance is allowed for), but the partitioning/allocation of 
cells between the spatial regions is going to be changing. I don';t want 
the BSP tree to store the partitioning of cells between processors, only 
the spatial regions themselves.
If I save the BSPCuts (vtkBSPCuts *cuts = 
D3Object1->GetKdtree()->GetCuts()) and re-use it on later time steps, is 
there a way I can tell the D3 filter to not re-use the cell allocation 
between processors, but instead to recompute it using the cuts provided.
Perhaps it will do this if I SetRetainKdtree(0), but supply the Cuts 
from above.

Have I understood this correctly. If not, is there a way of achieving 
what I want.

Part 2 : MPI/D3
If I create a D3 filter with an instantiation in each process as part of 
the reader, I will assign the MPI controller using the 
SetController(this->Controller) and this Controller was taken from 
MPIController::GetGlobalController - but this seems dangerous, because 
if I later turn on ordered compositing, or perhaps use a D3 filter in 
the pipeline, how does the MPI controller know which D3 filter belongs 
to which part of the pipeline. There will be two D3 filters per process 
one in the reader and one later in the pipeline and they both have the 
same RMI signatures. What should I do to ensure that the D3 in the 
reader doesn't send data to the D3 in the compositor and vice versa. 
Previously when I've used the MPI communicator, there has been only one 
of my filters per process so no possible conflict.

Thanks

JB

Subject: [Paraview] Transparent Surfaces Mottled
Message-ID: <7DA743946351514B4379886A@harpo.psc.edu>

It seems that there is a bug that causes transparent surfaces to have strange shading. This might be related to bug #2347 reported 10/27/2005 (it seems to still be open).

When the opacity is changed from 1 the formerly smooth surface becomes mottled (see attachment opaTst1.jpg). I've checked the surface normals and they are correct. The built-in sphere source (see attachment opaTst2.jpg) shows similar problems. Both
images were generated using ParaView's File->SaveImage and look the same as on screen.

System:
ParaView 2.4.4
Fedora Core 5
Pentium 4

Have others seen this effect? We've seen it on several systems and it makes transparent surfaces almost useless.

I wrote
[lots of stuff deleted]

So I tried it and here's a clip of an animation that shows what I don't 
want.
ftp://ftp.cscs.ch/out/biddisco/flowviz/D3_Test_1.avi

The partitioning flips after the first 15 or so time steps, and then 
flips back. The distribution is very good (this snapshot doesn't show 
the rest of the data, but it is well balanced).

I'd like to say
D3->KeepTheseCuttingPlanes(planes from earlier)

and have the spatial regions always the same.

Can it be done, and if I'm willing to dig into the BSP code is there a 
clear point at which cellIDs can be stuffed into regions that are 
already defined? I want the spatial regions to be the same in each time 
step, because particle tracking across the regions is better if the 
spatial zones are not jumping about.

TIA

John,

I'm a little confused.  Once you call SetCuts on a k-d tree, the
distribution should be set and will never be recalculated.  Are you
calling D3->GetKdTree()->SetCuts()?

On the animation I posted, I was not re-using the cuts, I was allowing
the tree to be recomputed on each timestep.

When I tried to re-use the cuts, as below - the first time the reader
executes, we have this->FirstTime=true and the Cuts are saved, then
reused on subsequent passes - but the first frame looks ok and the ones
after look very dodgy.

The data is Multiblock and the D3 filter accepts only Unstructured, so I
pass the data through a multigroupscalar filter and force the pieces
manually to trigger the copmposite data pipeline into looping for me and
generating multiblock D3 output (it works very nicely).
The first execution gives the "right" looking data, but after that it
changes and looks less well balanced. I concluded that it was storing
not just the cuts, but also some Cell IDs and since these were invalid
onsubsequent time steps, the thing failed to generate the proper output.
It does seem to work consistently after the second execution, ie it does
not change as you correctly state, but it doesn't look so good either -
and why does it change the second time. I'm checking to see if I've made
a boo-boo somewhere, but I welcome help.

cheers

JB

That's it - because it's multiblock - I'm only getting the Cuts from the 
last pass of the CompositeDataPipeline loop - so the planar slice is 
correct, but only for the final part.

Damn. How can I get the BSP cuts for all parts of the multiblock data

Hmmm.  That's a good question.  I can't think of a way that is not
completely hack-ish.  Perhaps you could listen to some sort of end event
on the D3 execution to get the last BSP cuts.

Another solution is to use the ability of vtkKdTree to partition several
data sets at the same time.  First, create your own vtkPKdTree object
(separate from that in D3).  Second, read in all of the data for each
time step and add the vtkDataSet from each block to your vtkPKdTree
(that should be easy because you are in the reader, right?).  Third,
copy the structure of your vtkPKdTree to D3's k-d tree
(D3->GetKdTree()->SetCuts(mytree->GetCuts()).  This should happen before
D3's first execution.  Now you should be ready to process any timesteps.

With this mode you will have one global partitioning that is applied to
all of the blocks.  Thus, each block taken independently will have an
uneven partition, but all the blocks together will have an even
partition.

I am sure that I did try it with the new version's mesh, but
probably I forgot it with the old one. At home an really old
starcd hexa mesh works fine with little endian.
Thanks for your help!

I believe the correct expression is "you da man!" - this is perfect. It 
works just how I wanted it to. Thanks for the help. The entire dataset 
is partitioned using the initial cuts and I get the output I expected. 
Blocks are not subdivided individually, but rather the entire domain is 
partitioned.

Having got it working, I can see that I may need to modify d3 to allow a 
AddDataSet(...) in a similar manner to the KdTree to make it cleaner, 
and from there, it's only a small step to produce a 
vtkMultiGroupDistributeData filter which would do the distribution on a 
multiblock data using the global partition, instead of splitting each 
block individually between processors.

For reference, here's an animation which shows the new processor 
boundary - it is no longer along the edge of the rotating doman, but 
further along to the right - the dataset is very long and thin and this 
only whows the left end. Having the new domain include the rotating 
edges all inside one processor is going to help debug significantly.
NB. The particles were supposed to change colour as the cross the 
border, but I messed up, so you'll have to just imagine it :) 
ftp://ftp.cscs.ch/out/biddisco/flowviz/D3_Particles_3.avi
(NB2 some particles disappear as they cross the rotating edge - this is 
caused by tiny cracks between the two meshes where they don't match up 
properly. I'm cogitating what to do about it)

Thanks again. (All I need now is to get offscreen rendering working and 
I'll be ready for anything).

Subject: [Paraview] Small bug creating Custom Reader
Message-ID: <F791129B5217E1419339F7BAEAAB4E17A93DC9@denver>

I am well on my way to completing a custom reader for Paraview. I have one last annoyance that I am trying to figure out. 
   The problem occurs when my file is read initially. The number of timesteps that is reported is always 100 even though that is not correct. I noticed that the Ensight reader some how gets this setting correct.
  I was wondering what the secret variable or method to call is? This is the last bit I am trying to fix before I let this go to my customer.
  The strange thing is that if you click on the "Play" button in the animation controls the timesteps field and slider will suddenly report the correct number of timesteps. I am wondering if the problem is the order that I am calling methods?

Any help would be appreciated.

Hi All,

I have spend quite a lot of time looking for the reason why the
vtkStringList class (located in
ParaView\Servers\Common\vtkStringList.h) is not wrapped and accessible
from python. Most of the other classes in the same directory are.
Unfortunately, I did not noticed any differences (between wrapped and
unwrapped classes) to explain this behaviour for me.

Could anyone give me some hint, what I have overlooked?

Thanks in advance,
Milan.

Hi all.

I'm having a problem with vtkImageData data arrays. When I "Accept" my filter,
it does all the processament that it should.

The problem is right after that, the the Data Array (on the information tab) of
my filter remains empty, and I don't know how to set that information. I want
to run the contour filter on the result of my filter, and I believe that the
contour filter doesn't get enabled because of that non filled data array.

Can anyone PLEASE help me?

Thank's in advance!

It would help if you could say
   - ParaView version
   - operatiing system and version
   - type of image file
   - can you display the image file with other programs?
   - are there any messages in the window from which you started PV?

Hi,
at the moment I'm trying to write data in the EnSight Gold format. 

I want to write some scalar data (velocity, pressure..., multiple time steps) on a NOT changing grid. Is it possible to write the grid only once in the .geo file? If i try that, paraview instantly crashes. Theres no problem, writing the same grid n-times, wrapped in "BEGIN TIME STEP", "END TIME STEP" wrappers, but that of course uses a lot of disk space.

Thanks for your help.

Hi Michael,
 
I guess, you're missing something... Ensight Gold format does not need one
geometry file per time step. Have you seen the example Ensight files
supplied with the Paraview distribution? What about the Ensight's user
guide?
 
The structure of your case file should look like this:
 
FORMAT
type: ensight gold
 
GEOMETRY
model: dam_1.geo00
 
VARIABLE
 
scalar per node:           pressure      dam_1_pres_****.scl00
vector per node:           velocity      dam_1_velo_****.vec00

TIME            
time set: 1     
number of steps:  32
filename start number: 0
filename increment: 1   
time values: 
     0.00000000
     0.01000000
...
...
 
The geometry and results format you can follow the examples of the Ensight's
user guide. Moreover, I've put some Fortran routines that I use to write my
files available to download at
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/EnsightRoutines.zip
 
I hope it helps you.

Hi Folks,

Due to IEEE Vis and Supercomputing conferences, we were late putting
out a snapshot this month. November snapshot can be downloaded from:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_snapshots

This is mostly a bug fix release. Some the new features and fixes include:

* Reading multiple exodus files.
* Many property panel improvements and fixes.
* File dialog fixes.
* Improved chart code.
* Improved testing framework, which now includes python.

Hi Kent.
Thank you for your help.

I'm running Paraview 2.4 on linux (windows too, but the develp enviroment is
linux).

The problem occurs after I run Voxel Grow filter on a vtkImageData.
And yes, I can export that vtkImageData to other formats, visualize it using my
widget and even apply other filters. No messages are shown. The contour filter
just doesn't get enabled.
My "Data Arrays" stays empty. I believe that is the problem. But at the same
time, I don't know how to set it.

Any guess?

Thank's in advance!

I _think_ I am.. Here is my RequestInformation Method.

int vtkParadisReader::RequestInformation(
   vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
   vtkInformationVector **vtkNotUsed(inputVector),
   vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
   int newFile = (vtkParadisReader::StringsEqual(this->FileName, this-

   vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
   outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_INDEX 
(), this->GetTimeStep() );
   if ( !newFile ) //The file has NOT changed
   {
     return 1;
   }
   if (NULL != FileOffsets) { // FileOffsets keeps some information  
about our file
       FileOffsets->UnRegister(this);
   }
   FileOffsets = vtkUnsignedLongLongArray::New();
   FileOffsets->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
   //File has changed OR file has Never been opened...
   this->SetCurrentFileName(this->GetFileName());
   //we want to walk the file and get all the timestep values and  
timestep indices
   if (NULL == this->reader) {  // Lazy instantiation of our helper  
class
     reader = vtkDislReaderLE::New();
   }
   reader->SetFileName(this->FileName);
   reader->SetFileOffsets(this->FileOffsets);
   reader->SetDebug(this->GetDebug());

   std::vector<double> timevalues; // Array to hold our time values
   vtkTypeUInt64 numTimesteps = 0;
  	
   reader->ExtractTimeInfo(timevalues, numTimesteps); // Gets the  
time Values from the file
   this->SetTimeStepRange(0, numTimesteps-1);
   outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(),
              &timevalues.front(),
              (vtkTypeUInt32)numTimesteps);
   return 1;
}

Did I miss something?

Hi,
i've a big problem...
I'm trying to write a real-time application that move a cone on the screen by a sensor that we have in Lab...I'm using a thread for acquiring data from sensor and another thread for re-render the cone onthe screen every acquisition...
but vtk (the cone was made by vtk) didn't like my thread...
have anyone another way to solve my problem?!!?

thank you very much for the help in advance...

Hi Cristiano,

I'm a little confused - why has this message been posted on the ParaView list? It sounds like an issue for the VTK list or a list that deals with threads.

Why two threads? Things would be simpler if you had one C++ program that looped where each iteration of the loop obtained a new sensor value and then called VTK to update the display.

The contour filter will not be enabled unless the image has at least one scalar variable attached to each vertex (called point data).

For example, when I read a PNG image, the Information tab shows, under "Data Arrays", that there is one varialbe of type "3 - unsigned char" attached to each point. Since this is a vector, not a scalar, Contour is not enabled.

What type of image file are you reading with ParaView?

Hi Kent.
Thank's again for your help.

I can now insert a data array in my filter and the contour filter is now getting
enabled. But, when I run it (accept button on Contour Filter), BOOM!
Segmentation Fault.

I have a DICOM reader that generates a vtkImageData (with a range from about
-2600 to 3600). That is the source for my filter.

It may be relevant to say that when I run the contour filter directly from the
DICOM Reader there's no problem at all.

But, I select my Voxel Grow Filter. Then, a data array with a range of 0 - 255
(grayscale) is setted for that item (Contour filter PV is feeded from that
vtkDataArray). With that, I add the value 255 (the image is already
segmentated). Accept pressed, I get a segmentation fault.


Well, what else do I must fill besides the vtkDataArray?

Thank you for your help!

This is due to the fact that VTK did not render transparent geometry
properly. We are working on fixing this. The solution we are
implementing will require certain OpenGL extension and might not work
on older graphics cards. I'll keep the list up to date.

Hi Kent,
I'm writing a module that move a pointer (a cone) by this sensor attached by usb to my pc. this module must run under Paraview (I'm working with v2.4.4) because the "cone" had to move on a 3D model of vascular system...
I tried to write a simple C++ program that loop ad acquire data...but It takes all the priority for acquiring and paraview update the display only at last loop...so I must absolutely use threads for solve this problem...I need at least one thread (for acquisition).

I'm sorry if I wrote this post in the paraview list but I posted it also in the vtk list...

thank u for the help

Hi Kent.

Yes, I've written the DICOM Reader and Voxel Grow Filter.

I found the problem. I must create a vtkDataArray with all the intensities of
the Voxel Grow's output, because the contour filter uses that array (it
doesn't use the vtkImageData) as input.

Anyway, thank you for your help!

I'm just curious... Why have you chosen the single file format? You could
write 1 geometry file an 1 result file per time step. PV can deal with
multiple file format without any major problem (even for parallel sessions).
Moreover, It's a good way to visualize your result while your program is
still running. The problem is that you can easily produce a huge number of
small files.

Renato.

Hi Renato,

thanks for your help so far! I've read the Ensight UserManual,  the problem
i described appears if I try to write in transient single file format.
According to the UserManuel I have to wrap my .geo file between "BEGIN TIME
STEP" and "END TIME STEP" wrappers. So is a constant grid together with
time-step values only possible with wildcards?

Further more I got a problem with paraview and partial variable values.
Ens_checker82 claims that my file content is correct, but paraview always
freezes after the first time step.

Regards,

Michael Geppert

I see... It's really a trouble. I frequently have the same problem. A modest
parallel running (let's say, 8 processors) with 1000 time steps and 3
classes of results would give me 8 x 1,000 x 3 = 24,000 files (and it's a
very modest run...). Even the operating system get lost with such number of
files within a directory. Unfortunately, Ensight Gold case file doesn't
support subdirectories (only server-of-server can do it).

Regarding the single file, I haven't used this format yet and I wouldn't bet
that PV is able to deal with single files since, I guess, it's not a common
way to use Ensight Gold format. In your case, I'd write a small program to
exchange data from single to multiple format (and vice-versa) or, as a last
chance, try another format. By the way, I'm not able to find any other
format, supported by PV, easier to implement and use than Ensight's.

Regards

Renato.

The problem is exactly the huge amount of files. We got 400 or more time
steps, 8 classes of results, its just getting to much for comfortable
handling. So we decided to try the single file format, if there are no weak
points, and we can use the same functions of PV. But if it turns out that we
have to waste so much memory, multiple file format may be better. So do you
know if its possible to write the data in single file format, the way I want
to? :)

Michael

I've been using a pv3 server and pv2 client for a bit of testing and it

the same time - or do I need to be careful. AFAICT they seem to be the 
same, but I'm not certain.

Is it safe?

Yes, it is safe. The server manager code is directly shared between
ParaView2 and ParaView3 so it should not cause any issues if you mix and
match the client/server if both are from the CVS head updated at the same
time.

Hi,
I want to use vtkIceTRenderManager and vtkIceTRenderer from Paraview
in my vtk application, but I have a link problem:

unresolved external symbol"public: static class vtkIceTRenderManager *
__cdecl vtkIceTRenderManager::New(void)"
(?New@vtkIceTRenderManager@@SAPAV1@XZ)

I'm a newbie, how can I resolve that? It's a cmake configuration problem?
I'm just modifying vtk's parallel processing examples, using
vtkIceTRenderManager instead of vtkCompositeRenderManager, will it
work?

There are some other examples where i can understand using of
vtkIceTRenderManager?

Thank you so much for helping

Mario

Problem solved! I had to set advanced options in cmake and turn
paraview_use_icet on...
Now I'm waiting for your suggestions here:

Mario,

vtkIceTRenderModule was originally designed to be a drop in replacement for any vtkParallelRenderManager (vtkCompositeRenderManager included) assuming you correctly use vtkIceTRenderer in place vtkRenderer.  That said, there have been many ParaView-specific changes made to these classes.

So my advice: try it.  It should work if you are not doing anything to fancy.  If not, you'll have to inquire about our money back guarantee.

If it doesn't work, give us a holler.  There may be an easy fix you can perform.  If it does work, let the future users know.

-Ken

Problem solved! I had to set advanced options in cmake and turn
paraview_use_icet on...
Now I'm waiting for your suggestions here:

You can add a derivatives filter to the Filter menu, and you can use  
that to compute divergence, gradient, and curl fairly easily. More

Subject: [Paraview] Change to Show Times from PVD Files
Message-ID: <5CA6BA5510A37301969BE1A4@harpo.psc.edu>

With these changes the times from a pvd file will be displayed as an annotation.

The times provided by the pvd reader will be initialized to the integer index of the timestep (0, 1, 2, ...). However, if you add the attribute "timevalue" to the "DataSet" tag then the timevalues will be used instead. A line in the pvd file that uses
this feature would look something like this:

   <DataSet timestep="2" timevalue="0.03" part="9" file="time2/part9.vtu"/>

Tested with version 2.4.4. The following files are attached:

   <source>/Servers/Filters/vtkPVDReader.cxx
   <source>/Servers/Filters/vtkPVDReader.h
   <source>/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml

Recently, I download paraview-2.4.4 and use ccmake-2-2 to produce the make 
file, it compiles well, but the weird thing is I have to be the root to run 
the application, otherwise, after  I load the data, the GUI on the left 
window will disappear.  I was able to compile and run paraview-2.4.3 just 
fine, but now, 2-4-3 didn't work either.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

ParaView would be great for displaying data as it is being created. That would help you tell when a simulation that takes hours or days has gone astray so that you can stop it before too many resources are wasted.

I believe that Kitware is currently working on a way to do this sort of thing; until then, there is Livedata 0.001! It is relatively crude and only works with pvd files but might just be what you want. For more please go here:

Subject: [Paraview] How to get a field value (single scalar) into the
	calculator tool
Message-ID: <456F56CD.6080104@cora.nwra.com>

HI,

   Does anyone know a way to get the value of a field variable at a 
specific point in the field accessible as a scalar in the Calculator tool?

   What I am trying to do is subtract a non-stationary background field 
from the solution of a simulation (velocity) at each time step. What I 
have is a half channel flow type geometry (with some other bumps). The 
inflow is an oscillating boundary layer flow. I would like to be able to 
subtract the inflow velocity in the stream-wise direction from the 
instantaneous flow at each time step so I can visualize a perturbation 
velocity. If I have the inflow velocity at a given height I can 
reconstruct the inflow velocity by height with the calculator tool.

   Ok, so I can use a probe tool to get the value in the field, but the 
probe tool does not seem to output the value to other tools (such as a 
calculator tool).

   Does anyone have any suggestions of how to do this?


   Thanks

Dan

Probably me :) If you describe the problem, I can try to debug it. If
I can't figure it out (most likely), I will ask Zack (our sys admin).

That is correct. It is from an axisymmetric simulation of a combustor.
It is a symmetric slice. I believe the result is from a bad simulation
run by GE.

It sounds interesting, but what is really new is the idea of PV
automatically reloading the data when something new is written. I'm saying
it because It's not hard to see your results when it's being created. In
fact, we could "easily" do it when using Ensight Server-of-Server format.
The processes write the pieces of data (geometry, scalar and vector files),
thus, the case and sos files are updated accordingly. In this case the user
only have the annoyance of reloadind the dataset all the time he likes to
see what's happening with his simulation. Of course, during this processes
you'll lose your pipeline...

Renato.
