I have been successful at migrating my custom readers to 3.0.1, using 
the plugin interface, and loading my stuff via the "Manage plugins..." 
dialog.

The procedure is manual and has to be redone each time I start ParaView. 
What I am missing is something similar to PV_INTERFACE_PATH, to tell 
paraview3 to automatically load custom plugins. Did I miss some obvious 
info?

Is there a run-time option, or some flag to set to enable automatic 
loading of plugins?

TIA
Jean

Jean,

The variable you are looking for is PV_PLUGIN_PATH. This is a
directory in which you shared libraries should reside. You can put
both client and server plugins in this directory. Only client plugins
will be loaded on client side and server ones on the server side. I am
guessing this information did not make it into the wiki page. We will
update that.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Calculator
Message-ID: <727356.89317.qm@web50612.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I have a dataset with 3 coordinates, x-velocity,
y-velocity, and z-velocity, and I want to calculate
the flux at a section with the calculator. 
The goal is to first compute the velocity component
normal to the section, such as a * x-velocity + b *
y-velocity + c * z-velocity.
I could do (a * x-velocity) or (b * y-velocity), but I
got inconsistent results when I tried (a * velocity +
b * y-velocity). I got different results even when I
replaced b with zero.
Any idea what went wrong?

I am trying to build Paraview 3.0.1 on a ppc Mac with os x 10.4.


I am new to cmake and have been trying to follow the directions here

http://www.insightsoftwareconsortium.org/wiki/index.php/CMake_Tutorial

the sourse is all in the directory $HOME/ParaView3

I made a directory  $HOME/pvbuild

This is where I intend to build so I
 >> cd pvbuild

and then

 >> ccmake $HOME/ParaView3

no matter what I do if I type c to configure I get

CMake Error: ParaView requires an out of source Build. Please create a
separate binary directory and run CMake there.

Am I just a bonehead.  I believe that I have created a separate  
binary directory and am running cmake there?

Can you wipe your source directory and start from scratch? If you ran
cmake in the source directory before, cmake may be getting confused.

Subject: [Paraview] Undefined variables in Ensight Gold Format
Message-ID: <200706031438.46856.martin.kuettler@gmx.de>

Hello

Can Paraview handle the 'undef' keyword in Ensight Gold variable files? I read 
(http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2004-April/000623.html) that it 
could not, but that was in 2004, and the file VTK/IO/vtkEnSightGoldReader.cxx 
looks like this feature had been added.
On the other hand I never managed to successfully read undefined variables 
with Paraview.

Thanks,
Martin

Message-ID: <006d01c7a6b3$24dc90a0$6e95b1e0$@ufrj.br>

Hi ParaViewers,

 

Does anyone know how can I get rid off parallel interfaces from a
distributed model? I used to do that by combining the "append datasets" and
"clean to grid" filters in PV 2.2.1, as shown here
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/CleanToGrid.jpg , but it seems
that none of the newer PV versions has the same capability or, maybe, it was
reimplemented in another filter. 

 

Thanks for any help

 

p.s.: I'm (still) using Ensight Gold format (Server-Of-Server/binary).

It's me again just to ask if what I observed is a bug or not.

 

The "node id assign" and "element id assign" clauses in geometry Ensight
files only works for the first datasets. When I try to load the second
dataset, PV 2.2.1 as well as newer versions, including 3.0.1, crashes. For
"node id given" and "element id given" no problem. (I have not tried "node
id off" and "element id off" yet)

 

Is it a bug?

 

Cheers

 

Renato.

Can you build with debug symbols on and then run paraview from gdb?  
You should then be able to get a stack trace at the point of the  
floating point exception.

It seems that new colormaps can be easily added in PV3:
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/Default_Color_Map

How could I add custom colormaps to 2.6.1? Ideally, in the "Scalar Color Bar" 
menu, the "Select a preset colormap" button would show an extended list of 
colormaps that include ours.

It would be great if there was a way to use the same concise XML format shown 
in the above PV3 example. However, I don't mind editing the source if needed to 
make this happen. All suggestions appreciated.

Subject: [Paraview] Wrapper Error in 2.6.1
Message-ID: <466475CC.4030200@psc.edu>

I'm trying to create a new reader but it fails during execution:

    vtkMyReader, could not find requested method: "GetTimeStepRange"
    or the method was called with incorrect arguments.
    while processing
    Message 0 = Invoke
      Argument 0 = id_value {486}
      Argument 1 = string_value {GetTimeStepRange}

But this method is defined in the public section of the reader's class:

    int *GetTimeStepRange( void );
    void GetTimeStepRange( int &r0, int &r1 );
    void GetTimeStepRange( int r[2] );

File <binary>/Servers/Filters/vtkMyReaderClientServer.cxx shows that only one 
of the methods was wrapped:

   if (!strcmp("GetTimeStepRange",method) && msg.GetNumberOfArguments(0) == 3) {
     int temp0[2];
     if(msg.GetArgument(0, 2, temp0, 2) {
       op->GetTimeStepRange(temp0);
       return 1;
     }
   }

I noticed that the first of the above 3 methods was wrapped in another reader 
although all 3 were defined. What's going on? Does the wrapping only work when 
I use the macros in vtkSetGet.h?

Using gcc 4.1.1 on Fedora Core 5.

TIA!

I see from the ParaView Digest that you have been successful in
migrating your custom readers to PV3.

..........
I have generated GUI and SM plugins, but a) they don't auto-load using
PV_PLUGIN_PATH and b) even when loaded through the 'Manage Plugins ...',
my reader doesn't show up in Open - File types.

I am currently working in Windows XP with VisualStudio.net 2003, but I'd
sure appreciate your sharing what you learned about the successful
format for PV3.

===================================================

Auto-loading was broken and has been fixed in the CVS version thanks to
Clinton Stimpson.
You will have to use the CVS head, if you need that functionality now.

Subject: [Paraview] client/server error for large superquadrics
Message-ID: <79E021DD17C2E241ACA0C8AD79C88A1701462E9A@EN-EX-01.uk.rf1.dir>

I am experiencing a problem with Paraview 3.0.1 when generating large
i.e. 1024x1024 Superquadric sources when testing client/server mode.
Smaller values e.g. 1024x16 or 128x128 for example work ok. Large values
i.e. 1024x1024 in local mode work ok. I have installed the repository
version of PV3 and MPICH-1.2.7 and everything appeared to installed
correctly. I have tried it with and without offscreen rendering. Clients
and servers have the foillowing configuration, SUN Ultra 40, AMD
Opteron, SLED10.1 with NVIDIA Quadro FX 3450 GPU with the latest NVIDIA
drivers

 

Does anyone have any ideas why this is happening?

 

Regards

Wayne

A minor correction to Jean's message. You can (and probably should)
the CVS branch for 3.0. The branch tag is ParaView-3-0. The bug was
fixed on the branch as well. The CVS head is currently going through
some significant changes so I would caution against relying on it for
production work.

Subject: [Paraview] how to run paraview inside a vncserver?
Message-ID: <004001c7a78e$a170b020$6801a8c0@theolt2>

We are running a computer configuration where multiple engineers share a
server by using vncserver instances. The vncviewer runs on our desktops. I
installed ParaView but when we are trying to start it inside a vncserver
instance, we get the error:

 

Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":2.0"

.

vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x865cac8): Could not find a decent visual

.

vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x865cac8): GLX not found.   Aborting.

 

 

So how does one resolve this particular issue? We are running Centos 4 on a
Intel Core 2 Duo.

Theodore:

Please try Sun Shared Visualization at:

http://www.sun.com/servers/cr/visualization/get_it.jsp

The download is free. You can run Paraview with TurboVNC and VirtualGL,
say, in a window of TurboVNC viewer, start paraview using VirtualGL:
vglrun paraview

Theodore:

The issue is that X server with VNC doesn't have GLX support. VirtualGL
helps to by-pass this issue and sends the OpenGL calls to the hardware.

Sounds like a bug to me. It would be hard to explain a crash otherwise
:-) We'll look into it.

Yes. The wrappers cannot wrap functions that return pointers without
some help. This help comes in various forms one of which is the
set/get macros. The other one is a hint file passed to the wrapper
executable. I recommend switching to the set/get macro.

Message-ID: <73141978E50F334AB7042807A520525E0154040C@exvicn1-mel.nexus.csiro.au>

Hi 

In 2.6.2, when I select the first (sat file001. vtk) vtk file. It
automatically looks for file names with numbered sequence (file002. vtk,
file003. vtk....) in the same dir and loads time series data. Hnece I
can produce a time series animation. 

 

But in 3.0, when loaded first file, it does  not recognise the time
seris data in sequence of files that are there, hence I can't do
animation.

Any help will be appreciated to overcome this problem in 3.0.

 

Thanks

Kind regards

Raj

Hi Renato,

What do you mean by "the second dataset"? The second geometry file in a 
time series? The second .case file that has geometry files that use 
"node id assign" and "element id assign? I tried both of these cases 
with some sample data and was not able to reproduce the crash you're 
seeing. Would it be possible for you to send sample data that 
demonstrates this problem in ParaView?

Hello,

thanks for your reply and sorry for the lag in responding.
I have made a snapshot for illustration:
http://www.shaman.ibpc.fr/pv_antialias.png

This is a simple dataset with a tubefilter applied. I use
Paraview 3.0.1 for Mac OSX (no parallel rendering) with a
Mac Pro and a Quadro FX 4500 graphics card. So I think the
hardware should support antialiasing.

I tried other background colors (gray, black) and indeed there
is no antialiasing either, although the jagged edges are a little
less obvious.

So I wonder what's the issue here? Maybe antialiasing could be turned
off on my installation for some reason?

Thanks in advance,
Marc

NB: Antialiasing is also missing with the previous 2.6 version of
    Paraview. So it doesn't seem specific to the 3.x series.

Message-ID: <b45d6a1e0706061214u37f7eb70vbc1614278cfc17b@mail.gmail.com>

Currently I am stumped on how to turn on or off the visibility of items from

inside the paraview console.

Currently I am constructing Line and Sphere sources by doing
sphere = paraview.CreateProxy("sources","SphereSource","sources")

But these always are constructed with their visibility turned off. I have
tried
getting the properties of these objects using the vtkSMProxy ListMethods()
but
that does not list it.

What do I need to access to be able to control their visibility?

I cannot find any explizit information about the metafile file format of the
vtm files.
Can anybody help me out?
Expecially for the hieracrchicalboxset format (AMR Block...).

We need to write a multiblock file with different refinement levels. Each
block has an uniform matrix dataset (equal resolution inside each block).
The image data format seems to fit quite well, but makes problems if not
every node of the "whole extend" gets values. Even if these areas are
overlapped by finer blocks. 

Thanks for any help or examples.

Hi Soren,

If you checkout VTKData from CVS, there is an example file there. It
is VTKData/Data/chombo3d/chombo3d.vtm. Let me know if have any
questions about the format once you look at the example. You will have
to provide dummy values for cells that are overlapped by higher
levels. I would recommend using values from higher levels if possible.
There are tools in paraview that let you explore a certain level. In
this case, it would be useful to have valid values even on cells that
are covered by higher order ones. Other than that, if you follow the
example of  chombo3d.vtm, paraview will automatically detect overlaps
and hide the cells that have higher level versions. In order for this
to work properly, you have to make sure that you specify amr_box for
each block properly.

We removed saving of batch scripts for a few reasons, most important
of which is the fact that it was in Tcl. We are considering replacing
it with python. We are working on better documentation for the python
interface. For now, the one on the wiki together with the server
manager documentation in the paraview book are the only documentation
we have. There are some examples in
ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/Testing/Python. Note that you can load
a paraview state from a python script.

Can you post a small example animation? This works well for me.

Subject: [Paraview] External Surface and Cell Blanking (post #2)
Message-ID: <4668462D.2020503@psc.edu>

Does anyone think this might be a bug in vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter? If so I could 
try to fix it. Its becoming a large problem for us.

-------- Original Message --------
Date: Thu, 17 May 2007 17:31:38 -0400

I have a reader producing vtkStructuredGrid data with cell blanking that
operates as expected with a cut. However, the external surface module always
shows everything w/out respect for the blanking. This is a large, transient
data set so I'd rather not use Threshold which converts it all to an
unstructured grid.

Should the external surface module honor blanking? Is there a nice summary of
which ParaView/VTK filters honor node and/or cell blanking?

Most of the blanked cells are in groups around the edges. I could figure out
which nodes are never used and also set node blanking. Would that help?

TIA

Hi Berk

That was the format I already have tested, but run into problems with
uninitialized areas. Because of that I have to write each block into an
separate "image". But this end in a huge number of files. Is there some kind
of "multi image" format for string a set of data inside a file without
defining any cells and points?

And I have still some problems with understanding the terms of the vtrm
file:

    <RefinementRatio level="0" refinement="2"/>
    <RefinementRatio level="1" refinement="3"/>
    <DataSet group="0" dataset="0" amr_box="0 7 0 7 0 7"
file="chombo3d_0.vti"/>
    <DataSet group="1" dataset="0" amr_box="0 15 0 15 0 15"
file="chombo3d_1.vti"/>

What effects do I have if I increase "refinement"?
--> does that mean that my indices of the amr_box of the level have to be
increased to?

And means amr_box="0 15 0 15 0 15" amr_box="minx maxX minY maxY minZ maxZ"?

SirAnn

Betreff: Re: [Paraview] [vtm] file formats

Hi Soren,

If you checkout VTKData from CVS, there is an example file there. It
is VTKData/Data/chombo3d/chombo3d.vtm. Let me know if have any
questions about the format once you look at the example. You will have
to provide dummy values for cells that are overlapped by higher
levels. I would recommend using values from higher levels if possible.
There are tools in paraview that let you explore a certain level. In
this case, it would be useful to have valid values even on cells that
are covered by higher order ones. Other than that, if you follow the
example of  chombo3d.vtm, paraview will automatically detect overlaps
and hide the cells that have higher level versions. In order for this
to work properly, you have to make sure that you specify amr_box for
each block properly.

Message-ID: <002201c7ac19$f1ad6120$0700a8c0@cod>

Hello all,
 
I have been using ParaView for quite some time no to visualise CFD data. So
far I have created multiple data files to visualise transient data:
 
Foo_001.vts
Foo_002.vts
Foo_003.vts
 
ParaView used to automatically enable the filename as a parameter for an
animation. Apparently this feature is not supported in the current release,
but will be back in the future. Is there a better way to deal with transient
data files? What would be the recommended best practice to create an
animation from a transient simulation?
 
Thanks for any advice,
Oliver

I?m new to Paraview. I?m trying to write a script which reads a file and
then takes a screeshot. I have several questions:
1. I don't manage to take a photo.'m trying with this:
writer = paraview.CreateProxy("writers", "PNGWriter","writers")
writer.FileName="c:\\zPython\\vtk\\jose1.png"
writer.Input=reader

2. I would like to take the screenshot with bigger resolution. I don't know
if there is something similar to:
vtkRenderLargeImage

3. I manage to incorporate what I want to the Pipeline Browser. Everything
start with Visibility Off. How could I turn it on?

Hi Oliver,

Since you are already writing vts files, it would be very easy to load them
in ParaView 3 as a time series. All you have to do is to write a meta-file
that points to your vts files. This is an xml file with .pvd extension. It
should look like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibData
Compressor">
  <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0" file="Foo_001.vts"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1" file="Foo_002.vts"/>
...
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

The value in timestep attribute is a float and should be the time value for
that timestep.

Hi there.

You can to create an XML based *.pvd file which will link all the
*.vts files in paraview. The file should look something like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <Collection>
  <DataSet timestep="0" group="" part="0" file="Foo_001.vts "/>
<DataSet timestep="1" group="" part="0" file=" Foo_002.vts"/>
<DataSet timestep="2" group="" part="0" file=" Foo_003.vts "/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

"DataSet timestep" tells paraview which timestep it should animate,
and "part" is a variable that you could increment if you had a
multi-block dataset (each block should have its own file).

Save the file with the pvd extension, and open the pvd file within
ParaView to animate.

This is what I've been doing. Not sure if this is the best practice :).

Cheers,
Bruno Fletcher

Thanks for the quick response - I assume the same would also work with *.vtu

Hmm.  Now that I look through the code, I see that the antialiasing
extension is not being enabled on either Windows or Mac.  I have added
bugs 5160 and 5161, respectively, to address this.

Hi Milan,

Ideally one should be able to do the following:

1) Animate camera
	However, currently camera animation doesn't work well with rotations: 
we'll address that issue soon.

2) Animate "Orientation" shown on the display tab
	However, currently only source/filter parameters can be animated i.e. 
the properties on the display tab are not animatable: we'll address this 
issue soon as well.

Until any of the above issues are fixed, you can do the following:
* Apply "Tranform" filter to the source/filter producing the 3D structure.
* Animate the "Rotate" property on the tranform filter by adding 
keyframe for it in the animation inspector.

Once the animation is created, you can save it out as a movie.

Hi -

I recently obtained a 42 cpu (850 mhz each) cluster on which I'm trying to 
get paraview running.
I've tried both 2.4 and 3.0.1 binaries (from www.paraview.org) with 
limited success. With 3.0.1, I've gotten the servers running with the help 
of MPI on each child node and paraview running on the head node, but have 
not been able to load any models across the cluster. With 2.4, I was able 
to get pvdataserver and pvrenderserver running on the child nodes, but I 
was unsure what they were doing or how to connect the head node with 
pvclient. When I tried to run pvclient, I got numerous errors with unknown 
causes and no available results on google. I have some questions to help 
me get started:

1. Which version of paraview should I be running? The screenshots on the 
website appear to be an older version than 3.0.1.

2. What distribution of clients, render servers and data servers should I 
have? Is there a sequence of commands or order of execution required to 
get all of the clients and servers connected to one another? Is it the 
same for both versions?

3. Is there any online documentation available for either version of 
paraview? I have the paraview 2.4 guide on order, but how helpful will 
that be for 3.0.1?

4. Are there any online repositories of datasets for paraview? I am mostly 
interested in learning how to load and manipulate the visible man data, 
which I already have access to. Computational fluid dynamics examples 
would also be helpful.

I believe you must compile PV from source, and link it to the MPI package on 
your system, to run it in parallel. The precompiled binaries are only for 
serial execution. I've had good results with 2.6.1 but haven't tried 3.0. Your 
MPI package will include instructions for linking and running. Use the 
information about linking to set the various parameters used by cmake.

Start paraview according to the instructions from your MPI package, e.g., 
"mpirun -np 4 pvserver" to run pvserver on 4 processors. I'd suggest getting 
parallel pvserver to work first, with a serial client on your desktop. Then, 
you'll be ready to look into separate render and data servers.

Daniel,
 
In general the following configuration works best for most.

- pvclient (run on your desktop)
- pvserver (run with MPI on your cluster)

Simply start the pvserver on your cluster (something like "mpirun -np 8
pvserver"), then start the client with the server machine name and port
on the command line (something like "pvclient --server-host=foo.bar.com)

Also I do NOT recommend the use of dataserver and renderserver unless
you really, really have a good reason to do so.... :)

Oliver--

I have attached an example of vtk xml-formatted results that I generated 
from a transient dynamic simulation of two pipes impacting at right 
angles to a separate e-mail (The Kitware PV mailing list will reject 
this reply when this example data set is attached).

One pipe is "steel," and the other pipe is "aluminum." (The contact 
algorithm was supplied with a pipe wall-thickness and, therefore, they 
appear to not quite touch.) This example is only ten time steps. (I 
usually generate between 100 and 200 time steps.)


Short Instruction --

In ParaView, start by opening the *.pvd file. At the bottom of the 
display panel click on the ">" button of the "VHS player."


Long Instruction --

When I generate simulation results I separate the model into parts by 
material. Each "part" (.m00x.) mimics a piece of a parallel data set.

Each "time-step" (.t00x.) is in a separate file. This is a requirement 
of the vtk data reader.  And the answer to your next question is "Yes, 
the model connectivity and coordinates are repeated for every time step. 
You can write current deformed object coordinates to save yourself the 
trouble of invoking the Warp filter. The Warp filter can still be used 
to scale-up further the deformation."

All of these files are referenced by a single *.pvd meta-file. (pvd = 
ParaView Data)  The *.pvd file is an xml-formatted ASCII-text file; you 
can look at it with a text editor. The name="abc" token is as yet 
undocumented; it shows up on the Extract Datasets filter's face sheet. 
The name="abc" feature is very helpful if you have a large complex model 
and wish to isolate one-or-more parts for close inspection. Otherwise 
the face sheet only identifies the parts by number.

This file-set is dos-formatted; the file-set was generated on a WinAMD 
box. I have tested this file-set with ParaView version 2.4.4 and 2.6.1. 
For a Linux box you may need to convert the file-set with the utility 
dos2unix.

Lastly, my current preference is for EnSight-binary-formatted results 
which ParaView reads. They are much more compact, and each point-date 
item and each cell-data item are placed in separate files with all time 
steps.

I am happy to e-mail to you both or either Fortran-90 subroutines that I 
use to generate results for ParaView to display.

Enjoy,

Sam

The LS-Dyna reader cannot read anything but part names from the input
deck (the *.k file). The reader requires you to have the output files
(named d3plot, d3plot01, etc.) in the same directory as the input deck
(the ".k" file). Are the output files present as well as the input
files?

If the output files are present, can you share them? If you can, please
submit a bug report at
  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/index.php
and attach a tar file of the files to the bug report. Without them or
some more debugging information, I do not have enough information to fix
the problem.

Hi David,
        Thank you for prompt reply. 
Yes I could open *.k if the folder contains all the output files. 
Actually I try to visualize a hypermesh data. I thought if I could write
out the 2-D element in *.key format, then I could use Paraview to
visualize it. However, it seems that I would need LS-dyna output to do
the visualization.  It is a bad news for me as my model is a STAR-CD
model. I thought I could combine the mesh element in *.key and Ensight
(result data write from Star-CD) to get a good visualization of my CFD
analysis.
	 Again, thank you for the help. Appreciate!

Lee Leong

I agree, it would be nice if the LS-Dyna reader could parse all of the
information in the input deck, but I didn't have the time to write
something that could parse all those keywords. However, there are
manuals specifying the input deck file format here

http://www.dynamore.de/download/con_download_manuals.php?frame=ok

and specifically 

http://www.dynamore.de/download/manual/ls-dyna_970_manual_k.pdf

You might be able to use these manuals to convert the geometry into
another simple text-based format.

	Cheers,
	David

Hi David,
       Thank you again for guiding me.
I am sorry to disturb you again with one more question.
May I know how to visualize STAR-CD result in Paraview? Currently what I
do is, I write out Ensight format from Star-CD and then use Paraview to
visualize the result. However I found that the visual is not up to the
expectation which I believe is due to Ensight write out flaw.
Maybe you can share with me how people visualize their Star-CD result.

Thank you,
Lee Leong

Hi

I have been using HDF5(2.6.5)  file with paraview 2.4 without any
problem. I tried to switch to paraview 2.6 or 3.0 both of them crash
with the same error message

ErrorMessage

What is wrong ?

Thank you for your advice

Hi Robert,

To make a source visible one needs to create what we call a "display" 
for that source. "Display" is a proxy which encapsulates the 
vtkMapper,vtkActor etc. Once must create the display for the source and 
then add it to the render module in which we want to "see" the source.

Here's the script that one can use to do the same:

import paraview
sphere = paraview.CreateProxy("sources","SphereSource","sources")


# Locate the view to which we'll add the "display". All views are
# registered in the group "view_modules" with the proxy manager.
pxm = paraview.pyProxyManager()

# Create a iterator that iterates over all proxies registered in
# a particular group.
iter = pxm.group_iter("view_modules");
activeView = None
for proxy in iter:
   # Locate a 3D render view.
   if proxy.IsA("vtkSMRenderModuleProxy"):
     activeView = proxy
     break
if activeView:
   # create a display for the source in the active view.
   disp = paraview.CreateDisplay(sphere, activeView);
   # Trigger a render.
   activeView.StillRender();

Subject: [Paraview] PNGwriter

Firstly, to change properties on a proxy one must use something as under:
writer.SetFileName("c:\\zPytrhon\\vtk\\jost1.png");
writer.AddToInput(reader)

i.e. property name is prefixed with "Set", "Get", "AddTo", or 
"RemoveFrom" (the last two are only used with proxy properties i.e. 
properties that take other proxies).

Now, to take a screenshot, one doesn't really need to create the writer. 
We can use the API provided by the vtkSMRenderModuleProxy to capture an 
image. Following script illustrates the same:

import paraview

# All views are registered in the group "view_modules" with the proxy
# manager. We'll try to locate the current view (assuming there's only
# render view created).

pxm = paraview.pyProxyManager();
iter = pxm.group_iter("view_modules");
activeView = None
for proxy in iter:
   if proxy.IsA("vtkSMRenderModuleProxy"):
     activeView = proxy
     break
if activeView:
   activeView.WriteImage("/tmp/foo.png","vtkPNGWriter");


Secondly, for saving big screenshots, unfortunately 
vtkSMRenderModuleProxy::WriteImage() does not take a magnification 
factor. It provides another method CaptureWindow() which takes 
magnification as an argument, but it returns vtkImageData object. Since 
any of the vtk writers are not wrapped into python by paraview, on can't 
  write this image data out. We'll fix that in the next release such 
that the magnification can be specified in WriteImage call itself.

Thirdly, to turn visibility of a source created through python on, refer 
to the following link:

It looks like your server is crashing because it is trying to open a
connection to the local X host and is failing.  You should be able to
correct this by either opening up the X host to the mpi job or compiling
with OSMesa (in which case the -use-offscreen-rendering will prevent a
connection any X host).

 

On a larger issue, ParaView 2 was able to correctly detect this, give a
warning to the user at the client, and perform all rendering locally on
the client.  Has this functionality gone away with ParaView 3?  If so,
we need to bring it back.

 

-Ken

Subject: [Paraview] client/server error for large superquadrics

 

I am experiencing a problem with Paraview 3.0.1 when generating large
i.e. 1024x1024 Superquadric sources when testing client/server mode.
Smaller values e.g. 1024x16 or 128x128 for example work ok. Large values
i.e. 1024x1024 in local mode work ok. I have installed the repository
version of PV3 and MPICH-1.2.7 and everything appeared to installed
correctly. I have tried it with and without offscreen rendering. Clients
and servers have the foillowing configuration, SUN Ultra 40, AMD
Opteron, SLED10.1 with NVIDIA Quadro FX 3450 GPU with the latest NVIDIA
drivers

 

Does anyone have any ideas why this is happening?

 

Regards

Wayne

Hi,

I currently write out legacy *.vtk files and load them as time steps.
I know this is a naive way but then I just started using PV. I dont
know much about the xml formatted files, so I would really appreciate
if you could mail me both the writer( f90 file) and the example xml
file. I can then change it and generate relevant output. Does the f90
file create binary Ensight files or does it create *.vtk files? As you
have pointed out, EnSight binary format is very appealling as my
datasets will start growing. Your help is very much appreciated.

Thanks,

karthik

Hmm weird,

Here's my script to create a 1000 spheres. It seems to work just fine 
for me.

Can you post your script?

import paraview

# Locate the view to which we'll add the "display". All views are
# registered in the group "view_modules" with the proxy manager.
pxm = paraview.pyProxyManager()
iter = pxm.group_iter("view_modules");
activeView = None
for proxy in iter:
   if proxy.IsA("vtkSMRenderModuleProxy"):
     activeView = proxy
     break
if activeView:
   for z in range (0, 10):
     for y in range (0, 10):
       for cc in range (0, 10):
         # create a display for the source in the active view.
         sphere = \
	  paraview.CreateProxy("sources","SphereSource","sources",
             "sphere.%d.%d.%d"% (cc,y,z))
         sphere.SetCenter(cc, y, z);
         sphere.UpdateVTKObjects();
         disp = paraview.CreateDisplay(sphere, activeView);
   activeView.StillRender();

Subject: [Paraview] Build Errors
Message-ID: <OF080ED918.C4610A66-ON852572F8.0051A38A-852572F8.005345F9@beckman.com>

Hello,
  I'm working on getting ParaView installed, as per a previous posting, by 
compiling it myself with MPI to run across our cluster.  I got the 2.6 
source, configured it, and made it... and the build failed with the error 
below.  I have since tried reconfiguring it with different libraries 
(with/without things like ffmpeg) and with VTK both MPI enabled and 
disabled, and the error is still the same.  I looked into the source, and 
was unable to determine a unique source for the errors, and looking 
through the expert configuration options did not lead me to find anything 
in CMake that helped.

The compiler I'm using is:
mpicc for 1.2.7 (release) of : 2005/11/04 11:54:51
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/3.4.6/specs
Configured with: ../src/configure -v --enable-languages=c,c++,f77,pascal 
--prefix=/usr --libexecdir=/usr/lib 
--with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/3.4 --enable-shared 
--with-system-zlib --enable-nls --without-included-gettext 
--program-suffix=-3.4 --enable-__cxa_atexit --enable-clocale=gnu 
--enable-libstdcxx-debug --with-tune=i686 i486-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
gcc version 3.4.6 (Debian 3.4.6-5)

and I have also tried this with mpicc using gcc 4.1 as well.

  One thing that I found really odd was that once I set mpicc/mpicxx as 
the compilers, I was unable to change them, either with environment 
variables or by changing it in CMake... as soon as I [c]onfigure, it 
changes them back on me.  I was able to use the mpic[c|xx] frontend 
scripts to switch back and forth between the gcc versions.

Here is my build error, as promised:

Subject: [Paraview] plot 
Message-ID: <20070612160536.GG5214@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,

 I use Paraview III (so nice) and I'd like to know if we can have
log scale for the 2D plot (probeline). BTW I couldn't figure how
to have dash lines (I have just seen how to change the color).

Olivier.

These are both feature requests that will be implemented in ParaView 3.2
(expected to be released around August).  They are addressed by bugs
4613 and 4943, respectively.

If I run the following script, Paraview crashes to the console with the
error:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  St9bad_alloc
Aborted

As I said if I remove the line
 disp = paraview.CreateDisplay(line, activeView)
the script will complete correctly, but I would have to manual turn on each
element
something that I want the script to do

#!/usr/bin/env python
import paraview

# Locate the view to which we'll add the "display". All views are
# registered in the group "view_modules" with the proxy manager.
pxm = paraview.pyProxyManager()
iter = pxm.group_iter("view_modules");
activeView = None
for proxy in iter:
  if proxy.IsA("vtkSMRenderModuleProxy"):
    activeView = proxy
    break
if activeView:
  for z in range (0, 10):
    for y in range (0, 10):
      for cc in range (0, 10):
        # create a display for the source in the active view.
        line = paraview.CreateProxy("sources","LineSource","sources",
"line.%d.%d.%d"%(cc,y,z))
        print cc, " ", y, " ", z
        line.SetPoint1(cc,y,z)
        line.SetPoint2(0,0,0)
        line.UpdateVTKObjects();
        disp = paraview.CreateDisplay(line, activeView);
  activeView.StillRender();

Hi Utkarsh,

I tried you script, unfortunately it does not seem to work for me as
wanted; I get:

Display could not locate the pqPipelineSource object  for the input
proxy.
Could not locate the server on which the new source was added.

Do I do something wrong? I use version 3.0.0.

Greetings!
Fabian

With the removal of the print statement, Paraview and the python shell both

I than tested, commenting out the CreateDisplay line and with no print
statements, the program ran correctly. It really looks
like that something inside CreateDisplay() is not working properly.

Can you be more specific about what you mean by "visual is not up to the
expectation"?

Hi Berk,

          Goody day!

          First I have to clarify that Paraview has done a good job and
the visual is very nice. The visual is even higher standard then some of
the commercial visualization tools.

What I trying to say in my previous posting is that, when I plot Ensight
case file using Paraview, the geometry has some flaws.  The defects are
such as holes on the surface and component mix up.  This is due to
Ensight unable to completely write out trimmed cell face from Star-CD.
This has nothing to do with Paraview capability.

 

Lee Leong

	       Thank you again for guiding me.
	I am sorry to disturb you again with one more question. 
	May I know how to visualize STAR-CD result in Paraview?
Currently what I
	do is, I write out Ensight format from Star-CD and then use
Paraview to
	visualize the result. However I found that the visual is not up
to the 
	expectation which I believe is due to Ensight write out flaw.

I want to load a few hundred VTK files into Paraview but the only way I've
found to do it is via the time option but i want to display all files from
the same directory at the same time. Is this possible?
 
Thanks Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Export output from "plot over line" filter in a text file
Message-ID: <f4b2fcda0706130313j3816782avb8532925adf4b3da@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm currently using Paraview 3.0.0 to visualize Ensight data. I am able to
plot a 1D graph with the "plot over line" filter. I would like to process
those results but unlike in Paraview 2.x, it is here not possible to export
the data in a *.csv file. Do you think a Python script would do this? I
found very few documentation on Python scripting in Paraview.
Thank you for your help.

Regards

Subject: [Paraview] paraview III and fluent ensight export
Message-ID: <BA212E6DB0B8964CBA5CAADB1E75EB78026D5566@DOVEXC582042.inapps.inergyautomotive.com>

Hello,

 

I'm testing the very great new version of Paraview III with ensight
files exported from fluent.

 

I just email to report the problems / bugs(?) I've observed during my
work: 

 

-          histogram is not working with following error message : 

 

ERROR: In
c:\berk\work\ReleaseBuilds\ParaView3\VTK\Filtering\vtkAlgorithm.cxx,
line 384

vtkPExtractHistogram (190B0950): Attempt to get point or cell data from

Reference Count: 1

Registered Events: (none)

Request: REQUEST_DATA

FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0

ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1

KEYS_TO_COPY: UPDATE_BLOCKS

FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: 0

 

This filter works fine with the AVS fluent export format but I loose all
the mesh groups.

 

-          plot cell over time makes paraview to crash (but I'm not sure
if I correctly use this filter) . I think it said that it need
vtkDataSet and I only have multi-block dataset in the ensight format

 

-          For the streamlines format the radius input can only have 2
digits which is problematic when having a mesh in meter and a inlet hole
of a few millimetres (impossible to enter 0.005 for instance)

 

I don't know if these remarks can help you... I hope so.

Hi Utkarsh,
Many thanks for your quick response and for the soon reported issues! I 
have all the same a problem with the transform filter: Do I have to 
apply it first or not? and I just have to select in "property to 
animate":/ Trasform - rotate (0)/? and how many keyframe do I have to 
have? because i manage to do a movie, but it doesn't turn, i think i am 
recording always the same image...
Anyway, thanks again for your help, and have a nice day

Milan

do you plot with ProbeLine then with that element activated, choose
Programmable Filter and put this script :

print "------------------"
pdi = self.GetInput()
nbp = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
vals = pdi.GetPointData().GetScalars("p")
for i in range(0,nbp):
  print "%d : %e" % (i,vals.GetValue(i))
print "------ done ----------"

of course you have to print in the csv format and to choose your variable
(instead of "p").

Subject: [Paraview] client/server error for large superquadrics
Message-ID: <79E021DD17C2E241ACA0C8AD79C88A17014C15B8@EN-EX-01.uk.rf1.dir>

Hi Kenneth,

 

Thanks for your reply, I'm not quite sure I understand what you are
saying here when you say open up the X host to mpi, as it appears to be
working for small superquadrics, looking back at my original email its
probably not clear what I was trying to explain.

 

I am running the paraview 3.0.1 client from my laptop and doing a manual
reverse connection from the remote data server (sl-cfd-08) and remote
render server (sl-cfd-08) both of which appear to have to run on the
same machine for this to work. To test the configuration I have been
generating superquadric sources. This works for smaller resolution value
i.e. 256x256, but fails when using the larger values. The fact that this
configuration appears to work makes me think that the setup is ok.

 

The following is the output once the connections are made, and the error
when using larger resolution values;

It looks like your server is crashing because it is trying to open a
connection to the local X host and is failing.  You should be able to
correct this by either opening up the X host to the mpi job or compiling
with OSMesa (in which case the -use-offscreen-rendering will prevent a
connection any X host).

 

On a larger issue, ParaView 2 was able to correctly detect this, give a
warning to the user at the client, and perform all rendering locally on
the client.  Has this functionality gone away with ParaView 3?  If so,
we need to bring it back.

 

-Ken

Subject: [Paraview] client/server error for large superquadrics

 

I am experiencing a problem with Paraview 3.0.1 when generating large
i.e. 1024x1024 Superquadric sources when testing client/server mode.
Smaller values e.g. 1024x16 or 128x128 for example work ok. Large values
i.e. 1024x1024 in local mode work ok. I have installed the repository
version of PV3 and MPICH-1.2.7 and everything appeared to installed
correctly. I have tried it with and without offscreen rendering. Clients
and servers have the foillowing configuration, SUN Ultra 40, AMD
Opteron, SLED10.1 with NVIDIA Quadro FX 3450 GPU with the latest NVIDIA
drivers

 

Does anyone have any ideas why this is happening?

 

Regards

Wayne

Hi Milan,

Yes, you have to hit "Apply" before creating the animation.
I've attached a test xml that creates an animation for rotating the 
sphere. You can play it by using "Tools| Play Test".

I think the problem is that you are missing changing of the end value 
for the "Rotate-0" key frame. Once you've added keyframe using "Add Key 
Frame", ParaView will automatically add 2 keyframes, one for start and 
one for end. You can add more if you like. In the next release we'll 
have a GUI which will make is simpler to edit keyframes. Change  the 
"Key Frame Index" to 1 and then change the "Value" to something other 
than 0, say 180. Then the animation will change the X-Rotation from 0 to 
180.

Wayne,
 
This looks like a 'compositing threshold' issue.

On smaller datasets the geometry actually gets sent to the client, on
larger datasets the server will try to render the geometry and then send
images to the client.

So
1) Turn compositing off... See if you can render the large dataset
2) Turn compositing on and set the threshold to 0MB (meaning that
compositing is always on no matter the size of the data) and see if you
get the same crash on the small dataset.

Let us know what happens, :)

	Hi Kenneth,

	 

	Thanks for your reply, I'm not quite sure I understand what you
are saying here when you say open up the X host to mpi, as it appears to
be working for small superquadrics, looking back at my original email
its probably not clear what I was trying to explain.

	 

	I am running the paraview 3.0.1 client from my laptop and doing
a manual reverse connection from the remote data server (sl-cfd-08) and
remote render server (sl-cfd-08) both of which appear to have to run on
the same machine for this to work. To test the configuration I have been
generating superquadric sources. This works for smaller resolution value
i.e. 256x256, but fails when using the larger values. The fact that this
configuration appears to work makes me think that the setup is ok.

	 

	The following is the output once the connections are made, and
the error when using larger resolution values;

	It looks like your server is crashing because it is trying to
open a connection to the local X host and is failing.  You should be
able to correct this by either opening up the X host to the mpi job or
compiling with OSMesa (in which case the -use-offscreen-rendering will
prevent a connection any X host).

	 

	On a larger issue, ParaView 2 was able to correctly detect this,
give a warning to the user at the client, and perform all rendering
locally on the client.  Has this functionality gone away with ParaView
3?  If so, we need to bring it back.

	 

	-Ken

	I am experiencing a problem with Paraview 3.0.1 when generating
large i.e. 1024x1024 Superquadric sources when testing client/server
mode. Smaller values e.g. 1024x16 or 128x128 for example work ok. Large
values i.e. 1024x1024 in local mode work ok. I have installed the
repository version of PV3 and MPICH-1.2.7 and everything appeared to
installed correctly. I have tried it with and without offscreen
rendering. Clients and servers have the foillowing configuration, SUN
Ultra 40, AMD Opteron, SLED10.1 with NVIDIA Quadro FX 3450 GPU with the
latest NVIDIA drivers

	 

	Does anyone have any ideas why this is happening?

	 

	Regards

	Wayne

Subject: [Paraview] client/server error for large superquadrics

Sorry.  I was not very clear.  As you know, you have two programs
running.  First, you have the paraview client application running on
your laptop.  Second, you have a server (pvserver) running on your
cluster which is run "under MPI" (that is, launched with mpirun and has
multiple processes).

 

What I believe is happening is that pvserver is trying to make an X
window.  This is because pvserver has the ability to remote render your
data, which requires a rendering context.  However, your cluster must be
set up in such a way that pvserver is unable to open an x window (either
you don't have xhost running on your server nodes or the permissions are
set up wrong).

 

The reason why you only see this on large data is that ParaView is smart
about where it renders data.  If your data is small, it will transfer it
to the client (your laptop) to render locally because it can be faster
overall.  If your data is large, ParaView will try to render it remotely
(on the cluster).  At this point pvserver will try to create X windows
and, hence, the crash.

 

As Brian mentioned in an email he sent while I was writing this, the
quickest way to get around this is to turn off the remote rendering
feature.  Go to Edit -> Settings.  Then click on the Server tab and
uncheck the box next to "Composite Threshold" to turn off remote
rendering.  This will force ParaView to always send all of the geometry
to your laptop for rendering and you should no longer see this problem.

 

However, in the long run it would be better to fix your install of
pvserver to allow remote rendering.  Moving the geometry to your laptop
can be horribly inefficient for large data.  You can do this in two
ways.  First, if you have graphics cards on your cluster, it is best to
set up the nodes of your cluster to be running an X server and to allow
any local X connections.  Second, if you do not have hardware
accelerating anyway you can compile ParaView on your server with OSMesa
support.  To do that, compile ParaView using the Mesa 3D library
(www.mesa3d.org) as your OpenGL implementation (setting the
OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR, OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY, and OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY CMake
variables) and turning on OSMesa support (turn on VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA
and then set the OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR and OSMESA_LIBRARY CMake variables).
Of course, you will have to turn back on the Composite Threshold
checkbox to turn remote rendering back on once you do this.

Hi Kenneth,

 

Thanks for your reply, I'm not quite sure I understand what you are
saying here when you say open up the X host to mpi, as it appears to be
working for small superquadrics, looking back at my original email its
probably not clear what I was trying to explain.

 

I am running the paraview 3.0.1 client from my laptop and doing a manual
reverse connection from the remote data server (sl-cfd-08) and remote
render server (sl-cfd-08) both of which appear to have to run on the
same machine for this to work. To test the configuration I have been
generating superquadric sources. This works for smaller resolution value
i.e. 256x256, but fails when using the larger values. The fact that this
configuration appears to work makes me think that the setup is ok.

 

The following is the output once the connections are made, and the error
when using larger resolution values;

It looks like your server is crashing because it is trying to open a
connection to the local X host and is failing.  You should be able to
correct this by either opening up the X host to the mpi job or compiling
with OSMesa (in which case the -use-offscreen-rendering will prevent a
connection any X host).

 

On a larger issue, ParaView 2 was able to correctly detect this, give a
warning to the user at the client, and perform all rendering locally on
the client.  Has this functionality gone away with ParaView 3?  If so,
we need to bring it back.

Subject: [Paraview] client/server error for large superquadrics

 

I am experiencing a problem with Paraview 3.0.1 when generating large
i.e. 1024x1024 Superquadric sources when testing client/server mode.
Smaller values e.g. 1024x16 or 128x128 for example work ok. Large values
i.e. 1024x1024 in local mode work ok. I have installed the repository
version of PV3 and MPICH-1.2.7 and everything appeared to installed
correctly. I have tried it with and without offscreen rendering. Clients
and servers have the foillowing configuration, SUN Ultra 40, AMD
Opteron, SLED10.1 with NVIDIA Quadro FX 3450 GPU with the latest NVIDIA
drivers

 

Does anyone have any ideas why this is happening?

 

Regards

Wayne

Subject: [Paraview] client/server error for large superquadrics
Message-ID: <79E021DD17C2E241ACA0C8AD79C88A17014C15EE@EN-EX-01.uk.rf1.dir>

Thanks Brian,

With compositing turned off the large superquadric is rendered ok,
albeit relatively slowly.

With compositing turned on and set to OMB the error occurs.

Increasing the Compositing Threshold to 100MB allows me to generate a
1024x1024 superquadric.

Regards
Wayne

Wayne,
 
This looks like a 'compositing threshold' issue.

On smaller datasets the geometry actually gets sent to the client, on
larger datasets the server will try to render the geometry and then send
images to the client.

So
1) Turn compositing off... See if you can render the large dataset
2) Turn compositing on and set the threshold to 0MB (meaning that
compositing is always on no matter the size of the data) and see if you
get the same crash on the small dataset.

Let us know what happens, :)

	Hi Kenneth,

	 

	Thanks for your reply, I'm not quite sure I understand what you
are saying here when you say open up the X host to mpi, as it appears to
be working for small superquadrics, looking back at my original email
its probably not clear what I was trying to explain.

	 

	I am running the paraview 3.0.1 client from my laptop and doing
a manual reverse connection from the remote data server (sl-cfd-08) and
remote render server (sl-cfd-08) both of which appear to have to run on
the same machine for this to work. To test the configuration I have been
generating superquadric sources. This works for smaller resolution value
i.e. 256x256, but fails when using the larger values. The fact that this
configuration appears to work makes me think that the setup is ok.

	 

	The following is the output once the connections are made, and
the error when using larger resolution values;

	It looks like your server is crashing because it is trying to
open a connection to the local X host and is failing.  You should be
able to correct this by either opening up the X host to the mpi job or
compiling with OSMesa (in which case the -use-offscreen-rendering will
prevent a connection any X host).

	 

	On a larger issue, ParaView 2 was able to correctly detect this,
give a warning to the user at the client, and perform all rendering
locally on the client.  Has this functionality gone away with ParaView
3?  If so, we need to bring it back.

	 

	-Ken

	I am experiencing a problem with Paraview 3.0.1 when generating
large i.e. 1024x1024 Superquadric sources when testing client/server
mode. Smaller values e.g. 1024x16 or 128x128 for example work ok. Large
values i.e. 1024x1024 in local mode work ok. I have installed the
repository version of PV3 and MPICH-1.2.7 and everything appeared to
installed correctly. I have tried it with and without offscreen
rendering. Clients and servers have the foillowing configuration, SUN
Ultra 40, AMD Opteron, SLED10.1 with NVIDIA Quadro FX 3450 GPU with the
latest NVIDIA drivers

	 

	Does anyone have any ideas why this is happening?

	 

	Regards

	Wayne

Wayne,

Super duper!

Okay now that we got the problem figured out... read Ken's email on how
to fix the problem... :)

You really should have large data rendered on the server side (that's
the whole point of the parallel rendering that people put lots of work
into...)

Otherwise, as you said, large data will be rendered very slowly... :)

Wayne,

If you actually want to fix the problem with 'Server Side rendering' you
should ask yourself the following question

1) Do the server nodes have graphic cards AND do I have administrative
control of the machines?

If so then fix the x window issue as described below
  
If they answer is no (for either reason) then compile the server with
Mesa instead of GL.

1) On all of your internal cluster nodes, create a /etc/X<n>.hosts that
contains the hostnames of the login nodes. This will allow the logins
remote access to the local X server on display <n>. If you only have one
display 0, then create an /etc/X0.hosts. Depending on the cluster setup
you may want to put in both the fully qualified hostname (fqdn) and the
short hostname of your login nodes. So something like,

#cat /etc/X0.hosts
login01.test.com
login01
login02.test.com
login02
#

If you want to be more explicit:

#cat /etc/X0.hosts
-
+login01.test.com
+login01
+login02.test.com
+login02
#

Functionally, they should be equivalent.

2) A more secure method is to define an XAUTHORITY environment variable.
Depending on your setup, ssh may do this upon login for you. If it's not
setup automatically for you, you can define the variable (eg, in bash
export XAUTHORITY=$HOME/.Xauthority). When doing an interactive qsub,
you can do a 'qsub -V' to inherit the XAUTHORITY variable. For a batch
qsub, define the variable XAUTHORITY your script. This all assumes a
shared home directory (meaning you don't have to propagate the magic
cookie to the intenral cluster nodes), and that ssh is enabled
everywhere with X11 forwarding. It also assumes you initially ssh'ed to
the login node with X11 forwarding. You can ignore any xauth messages
complaining about locking your $HOME/.Xauthority.

Hi,

Just a follow up question. Does it also work if I collect *.vtk files
as opposed to the *.vtu,*.vts,*.vtr... files. I have a bunch of vtk
files that i need to animate. One option would be to create *.vtu
files (thanks Sam)  and add a pvd xml file to collect the vtu's. But I
already have the vtk's, so its much easier if I can collect them.

Thanks for the help

Karthik

Subject: [Paraview] Large .vtp file crashes PV3
Message-ID: <CA99F7E0-C8EE-4F2A-B684-35B9BAC349E9@ed.ac.uk>

Hey folks,

I have a large c.370MB .vtp file written using the XML format. It  
opens, albeit after a while, in Paraview 2.6.2 on both my PowerPC and  
Intel Macs, but I've tried opening it in 3.0.1 on two different Intel  
Macs and it just crashes Paraview.

Is there anything known about an issue like this?

Cheers,

Craig

Subject: [Paraview] MPI-enabled pvserver using SSH
Message-ID: <OF8827AE7F.333B0E97-ON852572F9.00635DA6-852572F9.0065C844@beckman.com>

Hello,

I got ParaView 2.6 compiled with MPI enabled, tested it locally (it 
works), and went to test it using a few pvservers on the nodes in my 
cluster, and I see the splash screen, but (paradoxically enough) an 
invisible window is created whose title in the task bar is "unable to open 
display." This happens both physically, from the cluster head node, and 
remotely from our control box (connects to the head node via SSH with 
OpenGL-enabled X-forwarding).  Looking around at archives and searching 
online has only led me to one possible cause, and that is that when the 
pvserver spawns the children servers, they are not able to open an X 
display (for rendering purposes?). If they are looking for an open 
display, they won't find them, because X is not running (but it is 
installed and working) on each of the nodes.  Looking at the output of ps 
aux, I noticed something very interesting:
foobar      3597  0.0  0.2   4440  2216 pts/14   S    14:27   0:00      |  
    \_ /usr/bin/rsh n101 -l foobar -n /usr/local/bin/pvserver cluster 
36515 \-p4amslave \-p4yourname n101 \-p4rmrank 1
...
foobar      3956  0.0  0.2   4440  2216 pts/14   S    14:27   0:00      |  
    \_ /usr/bin/rsh n109 -l foobar -n /usr/local/bin/pvserver cluster 
36515 \-p4amslave \-p4yourname n109 \-p4rmrank 9
This uses RSH, which as far as I know does not do X forwarding.  What 
makes this interesting is that I cannot find this remote shell command 
specified anywhere in the mpirun scripts (they all use SSH by default), 
and this was verified by our MPI hello world program:
foobar     10621  1.2  0.2   4444  2220 pts/14   S    14:29   0:00      |  
    \_ /usr/bin/ssh n101 -l foobar -n /foo/bar/mpi/mpihw cluster 48369 
\-p4amslave \-p4yourname n101 \-p4rmrank 1
...
foobar     10869  2.0  0.2   4440  2216 pts/14   S    14:29   0:00      |  
    \_ /usr/bin/ssh n109 -l foobar -n /foo/bar/mpi/mpihw cluster 48369 
\-p4amslave \-p4yourname n109 \-p4rmrank 9

My thought is that using SSH might allow me to either (a) specify that 
X-forwarding is enabled by default (via the ssh config file) or (b) once I 
figure out how to set it, I can specify "/usr/bin/ssh -X -Y" as the remote 
shell command/options.

I have been unsuccessful in locating where pvserver determines to use rsh 
instead of ssh, as it is not specified (from what I can tell) anywhere in 
the CMake configuration or in the build files, and I cannot find in the 
documentation where this setting might be located.

My questions are as follows:
1. Why is my pvserver trying to use rsh when the default would appear to 
be ssh? Could this cause the problem I am decribing?
2. Are there any other ways for the nodes to connect to a display without 
X-forwarding? (did I misconfigure something?)
3. If it should be using ssh and the reason why it isn't is not obvious 
from my above description, what would the next step be in determining my 
problem?

Thanks,
~Kyle

somehow, for my ensight data the 'plot over line' and 'probe' filter
is unavailable... I user version 3.0.1
Strange!?

Looks almost exactly like vtk-python. Do you have an hint, how I can
adopt my vtk-python knowlegde to
paraview's scripting? Would be nice!

Hi Kyle,

Sounds like a problem I had using the MPICH-1 library on a parallel system 
running Redhat Enterprise. MPICH had to be rebuilt to replace rsh with ssh. 
Once it is built with rsh it could not be switched to ssh by setting options or 
environment variables.

It seems you also have another problem: pvserver should not need to connect to 
an X server if it is uses Mesa for rendering. You won't need mangled Mesa but 
do need to ensure that all the flags used by cmake are set appropriately.

P.S. It is always helpful when posting a question to mention the system and MPI 
package that you are using.

It looks like there is a memory issue somewhere. We will track it. However,
I have to say that creating 1000 individual line sources and 200 sphere
sources, all of which have displays, is not a common use case for ParaView
or VTK and is not something that will be efficient anytime in the future. I
suggest finding an alternative way of doing this. For example, it would be
way more efficient to have 1 source that takes a list of point tuples and
creates one vtkPolyData that has all of the lines. Same is true for spheres.

Oops. A bug. It looks like you can't probe multi-block datasets. I'll look
into this.

Subject: [Paraview] client/server error for large superquadrics
Message-ID: <79E021DD17C2E241ACA0C8AD79C88A17014C16EC@EN-EX-01.uk.rf1.dir>

Ok, we are now up and running, now we just need a data reader to get our
data in.

It's probably worth describing the issues I have had to overcome or
understand in order to get this working for other people just starting
out trying to get parallel rendering working as I am probably running a
different setup to what most people may be using - I think.

The first problem was the DISPLAY environment variable on the remote
linux graphics workstations not pointing to the IP address of my laptop,
in addition my laptop is running windows and the Xming X server, Xming
has a toggle to turn off access control, this needs to be done or
configured to allow remote clients to display. I guess doing this is the
equivalent of xhost + so probably not the best thing to do but hey.

Thanks to everyone who pointed me in the right direction.

Wayne,

Super duper!

Okay now that we got the problem figured out... read Ken's email on how
to fix the problem... :)

You really should have large data rendered on the server side (that's
the whole point of the parallel rendering that people put lots of work
into...)

Otherwise, as you said, large data will be rendered very slowly... :)

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.0 / loading series
Message-ID: <46710917.1050401@student.ethz.ch>

Hi all,

I am new to this user list so please apologize, if this question has
been asked by others.

I am trying out Paraview 3, and like the improvements made since 2.6.
One thing I have noticed, that does not seem to work, is loading data
series (e.g. files mesh-01.vtk, mesh-02.vtk,mesh-03.vtk etc).
In paraview 2.6 this worked smoothly, just opening the first, and all
others would also be detected/loaded.


Is this a bug, or is there a new way to do it?


If somebody is working on this, a nice improvement on the 2.6 behavior
would be to automatically detect new files in the series after first
loading (e.g. if you load an image/data, while the simulation is still
running and writing data.)


Thank you very much.

regards
Bryn

Hi Craig,

Can we download the file from somewhere to experiment with it?

These remarks definitely help a lot. We are working on finding all issues
related to multi-block datasets (which the Ensight reader produces). We will
fix these in the coming releases.

Subject: [Paraview] Python script for Interactive render window
Message-ID: <20070614123212.555.qmail@webmail28.rediffmail.com>

I am a newbie and I have a very elementary doubt. How do we make the renderwindow interactive (while using a python script) ? There is no Initialize() or Start() method in GenericRenderWindowInteractor. 
The only available methods shown through smdoc are :
['CenterOfRotation', 'InteractorStyle', 'RenderWindow', 'Renderer']

Currently, the render window cannot be made interactive through 
pvpython. To get an interactor to work in ParaView, there's some 
additional meat that needs to be implemented by the GUI layer. The 
python API does not provide for that.

If you'd like, feel free to add a feature request to the paraview bug 
tracker.

Works great. Just one small remark: when I start paraview its working
directory is the directory itwas started in. When I use PV_PLUGIN_PATH
its working directory seems to be the directory specified with
PV_PLUGIN_PATH (at least that's the directory the FileOpen-dialog
starts in). It's not a bug, but a bit annoying, because I have to
klick my way back to the directory with the data)

Thanks Utkarsh, I indeed missed the end value, now it's working.
Just a question though: my data are turning around some kind of point 
that i cannot determine; and it's quite annoying if you make a 360? 
turn, it goes out of the window and come back again. Is it possible to 
make it turn around the center of my 3D structure?
Best regards
Milan

Subject: [Paraview] Python script for Interactive render window
In-Reply-To: <20070614131536.25012.qmail@webmail17.rediffmail.com>

The "Distributed stand-alone" mode as described in the ParaView book is 
no longer supported by ParaView i.e. to run in parallel, one must run in 
client-server mode. This isn't that cumbersome really,
instead of
   mpirun -np 4 paraview
we do
   mpirun -np 4 pvserver
   paraview (and then connect to the correct server).

Same is true for pvpython.

Here's script to read a file and then render in parallel.

import paraview
# Create default builtin connection
paraview.ActiveConnection = paraview.Connect("localhost",11111);

# Create the reader proxy.
# Note that one must create the correct reader based on the type of the
# file being read.
reader = paraview.CreateProxy("sources", "ExodusReader", "sources")
reader.SetFileName("/tmp/somedataset.ex2")
reader.UpdateVTKObjects()

# Create render window
renWin = paraview.CreateRenderWindow()
# Till the view to always render on all processess in parallel and then
# composite the image together.
renWin.SetRemoteRenderThreshold(0);
renWin.UpdateVTKObjects();

# create and add display
display = paraview.CreateDisplay(reader, renWin)
# render
renWin.ResetCamera()
renWin.StillRender()

I tracked this down and I am not surprised about the crash :-) Your
graphics card is running out of memory. By default, ParaView uses
display lists which means roughly ParaView pretty much uploads the
whole geometry into the graphics card's memory. This is done for
performance when geometry is small to medium size. You can turn this
behavior off from the settings panel. Set "Use Immediate Mode
Rendering" to on. However, it will be still terribly slow as 370MB is
very big to render on 1 graphic card.

Sure, but for that we apply another transform filter.
Here's my example:

Create SphereSource (S1) with center at (1,1,0);
Create Tranform filter (T1) with input as S1.
   Change "Translate" property to (-1, -1, 0).
Create another Transform filter (T2 with input as T1.
   Change "Translate" property to (1, 1, 0) to get the geometry back to
     its original position.
   Animate "Rotate" property on this transform filter.

I have another comment to make.

When using pluggins, the --data option does not work because the loading 
of the plugin is not yet enabled.
Any chance the plugin could be loaded earlier?

TIA
Jean

Hi Adam,

We deprecated that reader. You can use Xdmf to read hdf5 files into
ParaView. There is some documentation here:
http://www.arl.hpc.mil/ice/XdmfUser.html
We will provide better documentation soon. Xdmf is a very flexible and
in my opinion very cool format. It uses a mixture XML meta-data and
hdf5 raw data.

Could you provide an example of creating a PolyData that stores a thousand

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Re: python scripting inside Paraview
It looks like there is a memory issue somewhere. We will track it. However,
I have to say that creating 1000 individual line sources and 200 sphere
sources, all of which have displays, is not a common use case for ParaView
or VTK and is not something that will be efficient anytime in the future. I
suggest finding an alternative way of doing this. For example, it would be
way more efficient to have 1 source that takes a list of point tuples and
creates one vtkPolyData that has all of the lines. Same is true for spheres.

I am currently working on a filter that requires the nurbs++ library. I
created a FindNurbs.cmake file
and have added all the details I think I need to the CMakeLists, but when I
try to load the filter the error
I get is "undefined symbol:

Is it an improper FindNurbs file, or do I have to pass Paraview the library

Hi,

I have paraview 3.0.1 on a MacBook with MacOSX 10.4.9, and i can't read 
any .avi file made from the animation inspector (when I rotate the 
camera for example), even with the latest quicktime or vlc player. It 
works fine by writing images (jpeg for instance) but I cannot read the 
avi file if I choose it. Any idea where does it come from?

Cheers,  Milan

N.B.: On XP, with paraview 3.0.1, it works fine!

I assume this is a plugin in ParaView 3.0?
Did you link with the nurbs library?

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyPlugin .....)
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(MyPlugin ${NURBS_LIBRARY})

Subject: [Paraview] It is worth to learn KWWidgets?
Message-ID: <1181920672.23325.78.camel@namaste>

Hi,

I'm preparing a presentation for my research group partners about
continuing our research developing on Paraview instead of the current
platform.

I reviewed basic VTK:
http://namaste.maia.ub.es/public/vtk-volume-rendering-tutorial.pdf


And now, I would like to talk about the GUI before going "inside"
Paraview. But I wonder if it is worth to review KWWidgets. It seems
ParaViewIII is not using them, is it?

Are the existing KWWidgets widgets going to be translated into Qt? Is it
possible to combine them, so use them in PVIII?

What is more, is it worth to learn Qt? I see all the examples under
ParaView3/Examples/Plugins depending on interface XML descriptions.


I could only find an old message in the KWWidgets list asking the same,
but with no answer:

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/kwwidgets/2006-October/000264.html


Can somebody give me an advice about this topic?

Thanks in advance.

I'll let someone else answer the question about KWWidgets, but I do want to follow up on one of the 'Check This!' sections in your slides... :)


You wanted a check on the following statement...

"Data does not "flow" along the pipeline. Each fillter has its
own copy of data, created from its input data. CHECK THIS!"

This statement (as you indicated) needs further qualification.

Most filters actually make a 'shallow copy' of the data and only 'deep copy' parts of the dataset that are modified or added. So if I have 3 filters working on a dataset, the data really does 'flow' from one filter to the other without being copied (most of the time).

Hope that's helpful. :)

Yes I the target_link_libraries. I think the problem is that nurbs might
depend on other modules, and do I need
need to include those in there on cmake file?

Sorry about that...  :)
I just had an idea: these MacBook don't have any graphic card, the graphism is directly controlled by the motherboard, it's maybe an explanation...

Hi Milan,

I just tried with the paraview 3.0.1 binary on a Mac Mini with OS X
10.4.9. I can open the animation I created with VLC version 0.8.6a
without any problems. Can you post one of the animations you create?

OK, thanks!

I've already updated the slide according to your explanation ;) It's
worth to know somebody from VTK have a look to the material before
presenting it to my research group. Thanks.


Now I wait someone else tell me something about KWWidgets and

Subject: [Paraview] Doubts in paraview scripting.
Message-ID: <20070618125045.30431.qmail@webmail60.rediffmail.com>

I have some elementary doubts regarding python scripts in paraview :

1. Can we get the normal VTK pipeline working in paraview.
   
   If we just want to have the conventional VTK pipeline in paraview script the script does not seem to work

      import paraview

      paraview.ActiveConnection = paraview.Connect()

      reader = paraview.CreateProxy("sources", "XMLUnstructuredGridReader", "sources")

      pyproxy = paraview.pyProxy(reader)
      pyproxy.SetFileName("fire_ug.vtu")
      pyproxy.UpdateVTKObjects()

      isosurface_filter = paraview.CreateProxy("filters", "Contour", "filters")

      pyproxy1 = paraview.pyProxy(isosurface_filter)
      pyproxy1.SetInput(reader)
      pyproxy1.SetContourValues(298.38, 396.84, 495.31, 593.775, 692)
      pyproxy1.UpdateVTKObjects()

      mapper = paraview.CreateProxy("mappers", "PolyDataMapper", "mappers")
      pyproxy2 = paraview.pyProxy(mapper)
      pyproxy2.SetInput(isosurface_filter)
      
      actor = paraview.CreateProxy("props", "Actor", "props")
      pyproxy3 = paraview.pyProxy(actor)
      pyproxy3.SetMapper(mapper)

      renderer = paraview.CreateProxy("renderers", "Renderer", "renderers")
      pyproxy4 = paraview.pyProxy(renderer)
      
      outline_filter = paraview.CreateProxy("filters", "OutlineFilter", "filters")
      pyproxy5 = paraview.pyProxy(outline_filter)
      pyproxy5.SetInput(reader)

      renWin = paraview.CreateRenderWindow()

      display1 = paraview.CreateDisplay(isosurface_filter, renWin)
      display2 = paraview.CreateDisplay(outline_filter, renWin)

      renWin.ResetCamera()
      renWin.StillRender()
      raw_input("Enter")      

      Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "test5.py", line 24, in <module>
	     pyproxy3.SetMapper(mapper)

      The Render Window does not have a AddRenderer() method.
  

2. How to get the scaler range of a given dataset. 

   The normal vtk script that I have written for the velocity glyph for a particular data-set is :

      import vtk

      reader = vtk.vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader() 
      reader.SetFileName("fire_ug.vtu")
      reader.Update()

      range = reader.GetOutput().GetScalarRange()

   .................... the usual VTK pipeline

   How do we get the scaler range in paraview


3. How to color the Iso-surfaces.
   
      import vtk

      reader = vtk.vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader() 
      reader.SetFileName("fire_ug.vtu")
      reader.Update()

      range = reader.GetOutput().GetScalarRange()

      iso = vtk.vtkContourFilter()   
      iso.SetInput(reader.GetOutput())
      iso.GenerateValues(50,range) 

      isoMapper = vtk.vtkPolyDataMapper()
      isoMapper.SetInput(iso.GetOutput())
      isoMapper.SetScalarRange(reader.GetOutput().GetScalarRange())

   .................... the usual VTK pipeline

   Poly Data Mapper
   None
   None
   None
   ['ClippingPlanes', 'ColorArray', 'ColorMode', 'ImmediateModeRendering', 'Input', 'InterpolateScalarsBeforeMapping', 'LookupTable', 
    'MapScalars', 'NumberOfSubPieces', 'ScalarMode', 'ScalarVisibility', 'UseLookupTableScalarRange']
   
   PolyDataMapper does not seem to have a ScalerRange method.


4. SetFactor not working with the Velocity glyph, and how to use the other parameters ?

   The normal vtk script that I have written for the velocity glyph for a particular data-set is :
   
      import vtk

      reader = vtk.vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader() 
      reader.SetFileName("fire_ug.vtu")
      reader.Update()

      arrow = vtk.vtkArrowSource()

      glyph = vtk.vtkGlyph3D()
      glyph.SetInput(reader.GetOutput())
      glyph.SetSource(arrow.GetOutput())
      glyph.SetVectorModeToUseVector()
      glyph.SetScaleModeToScaleByVector()
      glyph.SetScaleFactor(0.1)

   .................... the usual VTK pipeline

   The corresponding paraview script that I have written is :

      import paraview

      paraview.ActiveConnection = paraview.Connect()

      reader = paraview.CreateProxy("sources", "XMLUnstructuredGridReader", "sources")

      pyproxy = paraview.pyProxy(reader)
      pyproxy.SetFileName("fire_ug.vtu")
      pyproxy.UpdateVTKObjects()

      arrow = paraview.CreateProxy("sources", "ArrowSource", "sources")

      glyph = paraview.CreateProxy("filters", "Glyph", "filters")
      pyproxy1 = paraview.pyProxy(glyph)
      pyproxy1.SetInput(reader)
      pyproxy1.SetSource(arrow)
      pyproxy1.SetScaleMode = "Vector"
      pyproxy1.SetScaleFactor = 0.1
      pyproxy1.UpdateVTKObjects()

   .................... the usual paraview pipeline

   The problem is that the SetScaleFactor dose not seem to have any effect and the velocity Glyph's dose not scale
   What will be the corresponding paraview script for above vtk one.

5. How to get an Event/Observer pattern of VTK work in paraview ?
   I cannot find an AddObserver() method for any 3d_widgets.

This script is wrong. CreateProxy() already returns a pyProxy. Wrapping it
around another one would lead to errors. Use the reader object directly.

reader.UpdateVTKPipeline()
di = reader.GetDataInformation()

This seems to be a typo/bug in the configuration file. Someone called the
property SetScaleFactor instead of ScaleFactor. Try SetSetScaleFactor().

We do not use KWWidgets in ParaView 3. We directly use Qt. So, unless
you are going to stick to ParaView 2.X for development or you will be
developing a GUI from scratch and want to use KWWidgets, I would stay
away from talking about KWWidgets.

When the input to cell centers is a structured dataset with cell data 
vtkCellCenters produces points with no data. Is this perhaps a bug?

When its input is an unstructured dataset with cell data its output points have 
the expected data, now classified as point data.

Hi everyone. I have artefacts in my picture and I would like to delete
them. I thought I could do it with the filter "Clip". I selected indeed
the area I wanted. However I can't delete what's left.

Can you help me please?

First, thanks ;) I follow your advice and I stay away from talking about
KWWidgets.

Besides, I have "The ParaView Guide" book which in Chapter 17 explains
how to create new "User Interface" elements BUT I need help about the
differences among PV2.x and PV3:

      * the GUI/Client/Resources no longer exists.
              * [1] I cannot find any XML containing "ModuleInterfaces",
                I guess is substituted by the *.ui files, isn't it?
              * I found *.ui files in Applications/Client:
                      * I tried to see one of them "kdevdesigner
                        MainWindow.ui" but a lot of messages like "The
                        widget QMenuBar could not be created" appear,
                        and the presented form is empty.
                      * [2] How can we use kdevdesigner to see the PV
                        *.ui?
                      * [3] BTW, what is the Applications/DobranoViz?
      * [4] it seems Qt/*/Resources/UI/ is the replacement, is it?
              * if I try to see the *.ui files with kdevdesigner I also
                obtain empty forms...
      * So, I we need to design a new "panel window" (for example and
        extension to current Transfer Function dialog):
              * [5] if we describe the required data like
                ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/ParametricSource/ParametricSource.xml, the UI for that dialog is automatically created, isn't it?
              * [6] are some of the existing KWWidgets widgets going to
                be translated into Qt?
              * [7] is it possible to combine them, so use them in
                PVIII? (I guess no...)
              * [8] so, if we have to create them as new ones, is there
                any tutorial or example?
              * [9] BTW, where is the current Color Map (Transfer
                Function) dialog?
      * [10] I used 'cmake -GKDevelop3 ../ParaView3' to generate the
        *.kdevelop project files; is there any better way? (I didn't
        find it when configuring with 'ccmake'...)

Sorry for the mail length, I just tried to summary the doubts that may
be having the people that are studying using PV3 as research platform
for Volume Visualization.

After all, I'm leaving all the "answers" in
http://namaste.maia.ub.es/public/vtk-volume-rendering-tutorial.pdf and
will post also the examples and slide latex sources in case it is worth
for someone else.

Thanks one more time,

GUI/ClientResources in PV 2 was replaced by better formed server manager XML 
and Qt *.ui files.  Most of the time, widgets are automatically created from 
the server manager XML.
See #2 for why you can't open the ui file.

I don't think you can.  kdevdesigner is a wrapper around the Qt 3 designer 
with the addition of Qt 3 based KDE features.
You should use Qt4's designer.  If you want to use KDevelop with Qt4, there's 
instructions in the KDevelop wiki.

Use the Qt4 designer to open them.

The panel is automatically created based on the server manager XML as found in 
the example ParametricSource.xml.
The panels are automatically created for vtkSMSourceProxy's and owned sub 
proxies.
ParaView 3.0
A new transfer function dialog would not have source proxies, so it is 
currently not automatically generated.

Qt already has basic widgets that are being used as-is in ParaView3.

Some advanced ones like a color choosing button, vcr controls, transfer 
function editor, based on Qt can be found under ParaView3/Qt/* .

There may be some "un-translated" widgets for which there hasn't yet been a 
demand for.

Probably possible, but most likely not worth buying/writing the code to 
integrate Qt and Tk so you can use KWWidgets.  It might be eaiser  to just 
make new Qt4 based ones.

No formal tutorial has been made.  Of course, there are existing ones you can 
look at in the code.

A transfer function dialog is found in 
ParaView3/Qt/Components/pqColorScaleEditor.cxx and it supports volumes.

Search or ask on the CMake list.  I don't know.

Some of your questions seemed to be about extending ParaView3.  There's also a 
new plugin architecture that you might want to read up on if you haven't.

change the following line of code in your xml (server-side) file.

<StringListDomain name="files"/>

should be

<FileListDomain name="files"/>

This has caused me a lot of problems moving from 2.5 to 3.0, so you
might be seeing the same symptoms I had.

Changing it to FileListDomain is indeed the correct fix.
And its intentional that the filename box disappear from the GUI (now that 
ParaView recognizes it correctly).

I guess investigating the freeze is your next step, as I was not able to 
reproduce it with the simple plugin code you provided.

You're right Berk, one has to set the frame rate to  10fps to be sure 
that it works. That's fine for me.
Thank you very much!
Cheers, Milan

Ok! thanks! I updated the slides:
http://namaste.maia.ub.es/public/vtk-volume-rendering-tutorial.pdf

BTW, let me check:
     1. I "grep" VTK source files, and I only found vtkSmartPointers in
        a few files, why?
     2. Are there some cases where it is recommended not to use them?
             1. I used them for "temporal" routine vars, but not to
                return as pointers... is this correct?

Regards,

jor;)i

Changing it to FileListDomain is indeed the correct fix.
And its intentional that the filename box disappear from the GUI (now
that 
ParaView recognizes it correctly).

I guess investigating the freeze is your next step, as I was not able to

reproduce it with the simple plugin code you provided.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview 3.0.1 build on MacOS X is brittle
Message-ID: <20070619142534.GA21744@bromo.msbb.uc.edu>

   The changes made between the 2.6.2 and 3.0.1 releases of paraview
have broken the ability to build paraview as a simple x11 program.
While I understand the desire to change the build to allow the
creation of a paraview that behaves as a stand-alone application,
this prevents the fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net) developers
from packaging it as a x11 program that is executed from the
command line.
    It would be very helpful if the next 3.0.2 release were
modified to allow a simple non-application build of paraview
to be done on MacOS X if desired. That is a build that mimics
the build process for MacOS X from 2.6.2 and doesn't attempt
to create an application. Thanks in advance.

I _think_ some of the point of moving from tck/tk to Qt for ParaView  
III was so that X11 was NOT needed and a standard OS X application  
bundle could be created and distributed. So, assuming Kitware  
provided a prebuilt Universal binary Application bundle for ParaView  
III, then fink is no longer needed to install ParaView.

Just my Opinion.

Also, is there an option in Qt 4.x to build as X11 and NOT Carbon? If  
there is NOT, then you have NO hope of creating a ParaView III based  
on X11 on OS X.

It is actually possible to only build the servers and the python
client. However, these components also use Carbon instead of X11 to do
their rendering. There is actually no X11 dependency left in paraview
whatsoever. Although, it is possible to configure the server build to
use X11 instead of Carbon, I don't see any practical reason of doing
it. Am I missing something?

Mike,
   We do have a qt4-x11 package in fink 10.4 unstable so
it does appear to be possible. You might try installing
fink on one of your macs and, after switching fink.conf
to use the unstable branch, install the qt-x11 package.
I actually was able to create some paraview packaging
for fink 10.4 unstable that built against that qt-x11
package but the build got fouled up on the installation
process because paraview 3.0.2 is hardwired to always
expect to create an application on MacOS X.

Berk,
   I was able to build paraview 3.0.1 against the qt4-x11
package in fink 10.4 unstable. However the installation 
portion of the build goes astray because it expects to
create an application. What would be helpful is if there
existed an option for MacOS X builds to build against
non-carbon qt4 (that uses X11 instead) and to not
force the user to always create an application
(but install the programs ala linux).

I still need a _good_ reason for building against X11. Just because it
_can_ be done does not mean it _should_ be done. OS X users _expect_ a
proper OS X application bundle to use. We (OS X Users) have been
screaming at the ParaView folks for years to do this so we did not
have to rely on X11 to run ParaView. Now that we have it you want to
take us back to X11? I don't think so. I would rather see Kitware's
resources put to other tasks than to back port to X11.

Now.. having ranted about all that I am going to jump to the other
side. Last week Apple announced that the only 64Bit GUIs going forward
will be Cocoa and X11. This leaves those of us wanting a 64 bit
version of ParaVIew on OS X in a bind. Qt bases there implementation
on Carbon, therefor no 64Bit ParaView for OS X. So the only way I am
seeing to get 64 Bit paraview on OS X would be if we continue to build
against X11, which just completely SUCKS. And I am going to jump out
on a limb and hope that the Qt4-X11 package is NOT based on Carbon.
Further more for me to even consider this is if the Qt4X11 package
becomes STABLE, not UNSTABLE. I have clients to serve and putting
buggy software on their machines and saying "deal with it" is not a
good reflection on me or Kitware.

Cheers
Mike Jackson

Mike,
   I'm not saying that you have to take the MacOS X build
back to X11. Just make the build process flexible enough
that if Carbon QT isn't being used, the MacOS X build
defaults back to a linux-like X11 build. It shouldn't
be rocket science to do that. 
                  Jack

Hi,
I'd like to second Jack's appeal for a fink-based (qt4-x11 dependent) 
paraview build and hopefully provide a valid reason for doing so.

It is great that Kitware now provides an OSX native version, but as 
soon as you need/want to recompile the software you'll have a very 
steep installation curve and some sleepless nights.

In particular I wanted to rebuild a parallel (mpi) version of 
paraview, and could so far not manage to get a proper build with the 
v3.x versions.
Building with fink - given the automatic dependency handling - is a 
pleasure though, and I now use paraview 2.6 as it is in fink and I 
could recompile a functional mpi version (thanks to Martin Costabel).

This is all probably due to my incompetence in Mac software development/
installation issues (although I am not really a newby), but the point 
is if spending a couple of days going through mailing lists and trying 
to build such a big package as paraview don't succeed, many users will 
probably be put off to try and build paraview from source to tune it to 
their needs and eventually also contribute back some improvements.

Fink provides all that.. if paraview 3 is in fink, every fink user will 
be able to recompile it, no issue here. I think this could be seen as an
important benefit.

(of course in an ideal world, the fink-paraview 3 version would than 
eventually have an option to swap-out qt4-x11 against osx-native qt4 
like the choice between Apple's X11 or Fink X11.. but that's an 
entirely different issue, I think)

Just my 2 cents,
Cheers,

Jack,

I'm guessing it is almost as simple as replacing most IF(APPLE) to 
IF(Q_WS_MAC) in the CMakeLists.txt files.

Is that something you can try out?

Hi folks,

A few comments:

1. We do not have any plans to support a paraview built with x11 on
the Mac. It is great that fink is distributing paraview but if you are
running it and run into any stability issues related to rendering, you
will be on your own. I simply don't have time or funding to maintain
it. Furthermore, some of the optimizations and GPU related features
will not be available through the x11 version because the default glx
does not support all extensions accessible through Carbon or Cocoa.

2. If someone can fix the CMakeLists.txt files  by following Clint's
advice and the fix is reasonable, I would be very happy to incorporate
it in the official source base.

3.  I just read on the whole Carbon/64 bit issue. It is a shame.
Hopefully, the decision is not to never have a 64 bit Carbon but it is
not having it in Leopard to avoid delays. Either way, you will have to
either build an x11 version of paraview or run in client/server and
build the server separately using Cocoa to have 64 bit support in
Leopard.

Hi,

In http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:pvpython
pyProxy wrapper it says it exists:


pyProxy.ListMethods() can be used to obtain a list of property names
provided by the proxy.

and I think it should say:

pyProxy.ListProperties() can be used to obtain a list of property names
provided by the proxy.

Thanks a lot for all the answers!

Right now, the "[Paraview] It is worth to learn KWWidgets?" "case" is
"closed" ;)

I'm advancing, forgetting about KWWidgets, having a look to Qt UI with
designer-qt4 and studying the new plugin architecture...

I leave my personal notes in
http://namaste.maia.ub.es/public/vtk-volume-rendering-tutorial.pdf


Thanks again,

I am getting an error trying to compile PV3. I pulled PV301 from CVS  
and during the compile I get the following error:

[ 85%] Built target pvserver

Couple things to note. I built Qt with Frameworks. During ccmake  
phase, cmake could not find the QtAssistant and QtDesigner include  
directories. I had to manually point those cmake variables at the  
proper framework/Headers folder. This is on OS X 10.4.9 Intel with  
the Qt OpenSource 4.3.0 edition. Using Same compiler on each.

Anyone?

I assume you're using an older version of CMake than me (I'm using 2.4.6)?
Qt4 support in CMake has been patched a bit since we started ParaView3.
If that's it, then rebuilding Qt as shared libs instead of frameworks 
probably won't make a difference.

Hi,

missing something obvious, but how do you create labeled axes? And the 
second is how do you get Contour to work with .vtu files, because when i

different Renderers of a running Paraview, but I found some problems.

I inserted the questions in the script code that is placed below.

Can anybody help me to understand how to perform it in Paraview
scripting?

Thanks in advance,

I just got done compiling against Qt 4.3 as shared libraries and the  
compile completed just fine. So I am going to assume there is a  
problem compiling against Qt Frameworks versus Qt Shared Libs.

That is not a good assumption. I always compile against Qt frameworks.
In fact, that is what I have been using to make binaries since the
beginning of the ParaView 3 project. I would take a look at Clint's
message:

I assume you're using an older version of CMake than me (I'm using 2.4.6)?
Qt4 support in CMake has been patched a bit since we started ParaView3.
If that's it, then rebuilding Qt as shared libs instead of frameworks
probably won't make a difference.

I am using Cmake 2.4.6 Release. Do I need to move up to a cvs version  
of cmake?

Is there maybe a problem with a "non-standard" Qt 4.3 installation  
path? (Mine is in /Developer/Toolkits/Qt-4.3)

Other than that I am not sure what the problem could be although I am  
willing to spend some time trying to track down the problem.

Hmmm. Puzzling. Clint, have you compiled with Qt 4.3 yet? I have been
using Qt 4.2.2 and 4.2.3. My build process is simple:
* Compile and install Qt (I used /opt/qt-4.x.x)
* Configure paraview, set path to qmake
* Compile

So far, I built on a Mac Pro, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini (intel and ppc),
all running 10.4.9 with Xcode 2.4.1. I use make to build, not Xcode.

Looking in the FindQt4.cmake about line 490 is the following:

   # Set QT_QTDESIGNER_INCLUDE_DIR
   FIND_PATH(QT_QTDESIGNER_INCLUDE_DIR QDesignerComponents <======
     PATHS
     ${QT_INCLUDE_DIR}/QtDesigner
     ${QT_HEADERS_DIR}/QtDesigner
     NO_DEFAULT_PATH
     )

Shouldn't we be looking for QDesigner? or are we _really_ wanting to  
find QDesignerComponents? The latter of which does NOT have a Headers  
folder in the framework, at least under Qt 4.3

Not sure if this is the root of the problem or not. I am trying to  
wade through the FindQt4.cmake file to figure what is going on.

Message-ID: <b45d6a1e0706200737i5cb13227v4c842ac1396e86d2@mail.gmail.com>

I have created a Paraview filter that uses the vtk class
vtkSurfaceReconstrucitonFilter. I have no problem loading in the filter, but
when I run the filter, the output
I get is just an empty box. The comments in the code, suggest that the
output should be a volume, but when I try to view the volume I get the error
"Cannot volume render since no point data available!". Do I need to change
the way the filter updates the output, or is this a problem relating to the
volume renderer?

Can you check that you have "-framework Carbon" as a linker flag when building 
pqWidgets?  FindQt4.cmake didn't always do that, which is why I wondered if 
you were using an older one.

Yes, the linker flag is there.

Here is what I have done:

Installed a clean copy of Cmake 2.4.6
Built 4 Versions of Qt:
     Qt 4.2.3 as Dylibs and as Frameworks
     Qt 4.3.0 as Dylibs and as Frameworks

Running ccmake on ParaView 3 will cause the following Error on ALL  
versions of Qt built with Frameworks:

Qt ASSISTANT library not found.

CMake Error: This project requires some variables to be set,
and cmake can not find them.
Please set the following variables:
QT_QTDESIGNER_INCLUDE_DIR (ADVANCED)

If I point QTDIR to either of my Qt Dylib builds (4.2.3 and 4.3.0),  
then cmake proceeds without error.

I have also noticed the following differences:

In the Qt Framework builds the QtAssistant.framework is available.
In the Qt DyLib Builds there is a library called QtAssistantClient

Maybe this is messing things up?

I just realized I had copied FindQt4.cmake and UseQt4.cmake from CVS into my 
2.4.6 install on the Mac.  Finding Qt Assistant and Designer on the Mac are 
among the differences.

Let me finish my Qt build check a few things and make some patches for 
ParaView to help the build on the Mac with a clean CMake 2.4.6.

Not sure what the differences are BUT I at least found these:

in a clean cmake 2.4.6 install, in the FindQt4.cmake around line 482,  
the lines should be:

   # Set QT_QTASSISTANT_INCLUDE_DIR
   FIND_PATH(QT_QTASSISTANT_INCLUDE_DIR QtAssistant
     PATHS
     ${QT_INCLUDE_DIR}/QtAssistant
     ${QT_LIBRARY_DIR}/QtAssistant.framework/Headers
     NO_DEFAULT_PATH
     )

   # Set QT_QTDESIGNER_INCLUDE_DIR
   FIND_PATH(QT_QTDESIGNER_INCLUDE_DIR QDesignerComponents
     PATHS
     ${QT_INCLUDE_DIR}/QtDesigner
     ${QT_LIBRARY_DIR}/QtDesigner.framework/Headers
     NO_DEFAULT_PATH
     )

Also, the Carbon, Application Services and QuickTime frameworks are  
NOT added for Linker flags in ParaView 3 using Frameworks which is  
contrary to what I posted earlier.

Yes.  And I'll patch ParaView so the build will working with that deficiency 
in FindQt4.cmake.

Thanks for clarifying that.  I expected that.  I'll look into this one as 
well.

So if you'll just give me some time, I'll probably have fixes this 
afternoon.  :)

Subject: [Paraview] Cut plane surface rendering
Message-ID: <9A20D176-2118-4C1B-9E4F-BA90712DCC39@mail.med.upenn.edu>

Hi all,

I have volume brain data which I am slicing with cut planes. I set  
representation to "surface", Interpolation to "flat", and turn off  
"Interpolate Colors" under "Color". The surface polygons are colored  
in a strange manner, such that the pixels of my image appear to be  
sheared. I have placed an image showing the effect on the web:

http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cookpa/paraview.png

The effect is the same for cut planes with a Y or Z normal. But if I  
make a plane with an X normal, the surface appears correct, ie the  
pixels are square.

I am running Paraview 3.0.0 on Mac OS X. The same effect is apparent  
on the Linux Paraview 3.0.0. The volume is a VTK scalar image  
containing RGB unsigned-char triplets for each voxel (in the image on  
the web I have mapped the scalars to a grayscale LUT). The header is:

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
Camino RGB-scalar image
BINARY
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 112 112 60
SPACING 2.0 2.0 2.0
ORIGIN 0 0 0
POINT_DATA 752640
COLOR_SCALARS scalars 3

I can reproduce the same effect with MetaIO data, header

ObjectType = IMAGE
NDims = 3
BinaryData = True
BinaryDataByteOrderMSB = True
TransformMatrix = 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
Offset = 0.0 0.0 0.0
CenterOfRotation = 0.0 0.0 0.0
AnatomicalOrientation = LPI
ElementSpacing = 2.0 2.0 2.0
DimSize = 112 112 60
ElementNumberOfChannels = 3
ElementType = MET_UCHAR
ElementDataFile = LOCAL

I'm not sure if this is a bug or if I need to do something to the cut  
planes.

Thanks in advance,

I think I start understanding the differences between the VTK pipeline
and the way to proceed in Paraview... So, I could draw two "objects"
with different visual properties.

I brief, I have in mind the following:

VTK                       = PARAVIEW
readers, writers, filters = use "sources"
mappers, actors           = use "displays"
camera, lights            = use "render module"

So the working script is listed below. I still have doubts about
connecting to a running Paraview from a script... but tomorrow I'll
continue working...

BTW, really interesting the python console on PV, it let me experiment
all this stuff "on-line". Congrats to developers! It's really a flexible
and extensible scheme.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3 Plugin Attempt
Message-ID: <4CB50AC1-C2CB-49BC-B68E-7B929A874EBD@gmail.com>

I am attempting to migrate our ParaView 2.x based plugin (Reader and  
2 filters) to ParaView 3. I have looked through the examples and read  
the Wiki Page but I am missing something.

I am taking the approach where I tell cmake to use a  
PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_MODULE call "PVDislocation". I tell it the source  
directory and all that. I have a PVDislocationParaViewImport.cmake  
file at the top level of my PVDislocation directory.

When "configuring" in cmake I get the following Error:

538:[mjackson@Thor:pv3]$ cmake ../ParaView3
-- Found Qt-Version 4.3.0
-- Finding Atomic Data Sizes
-- Finding a 64 Bit Integer
CMake Error: Error in cmake code at
/Users/mjackson/Task_4/Workspace/PVDislocation/ 
PVDislocationParaViewImport.cmake:65:
Unknown CMake command "ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN".
-- Configuring done

Here is the contents of the PVDislocationParaViewImport.cmak file:
-------------

Any help or pushes in the right direction would be appreciated.

The PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_MODULE is for building extra code *into* ParaView.
So you don't use it when building plugins.

Just add 
  FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
  INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

At the top of your CMakeLists.txt file (renamed from 
PVDislocationParaViewImport.cmake)

remove the calls PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_WRAPPED_SOURCES and PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SOURCES

add 
SOURCES ${PVDislocation_SRCS}
to the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN call.

Then do your own run of CMake outside of ParaView, and go from there.

There's also examples you can look at.

Sorry for the miss-understanding then.. I want to build my code  
_into_ paraview 3 like I do now for Paraview 2.x. The way that is  
done for ParaView 2.x is by using the  
PVDislocationParaViewImport.cmake file. Is this different now for  
ParaView 3? The PV3 wiki page does not make much of a distinction.

Ah, ok.  Here's how you build it into ParaView 3.

You do the server manager part the same as in ParaView 2.x.
Which means you need to put back your call to 
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SERVERMANAGER_RESOURCES.

To add your custom readers so it will be in the file dialog, you can 
write an XML file following the format of
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_custom_filter.2C_reader_or_writer
That is just one xml file with <ParaViewReaders> .... </ParaViewReaders>
And call
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_GUI_RESOURCES("${PVDislocation_SOURCE_DIR}/GUIReaders.xml")

Thanks,
   I just about got it figured out when I got your email. Now the  
next step.

I have a reader, and 2 filters. Can I have individual Server Manager  
xml files for each? In my old project I combined everything into a  
single xml file for the server manager and a single xml file for the  
gui.

Does this still hold? Assuming I can handle the autogenerated gui  
that Paraview will produce?

When I get this working I plan to add some more detail to the Wiki  
Page... :-)

Message-ID: <121FE3D2-CFA8-4AE4-B67F-07B14E590B2B@gmail.com>

I am updating a plugin from PV 2.x to PV 3 and I would like to be  
able to keep some backwards compatibility to the 2.x series. Is there  
a way in my <ModuleName>ParaViewImport.cmake file to detect if  
ParaView 2 or 3 is being compiled? There are just enough small  
differences that I think this might be the best way rather than  
duplicating most of the code into another project directory and  
starting off fresh.

THanks

Stereo File you need to modify for CRYSTAL_EYES:

 In paraview-source/VTK/Rendering/vtkRenderWindow.cxx, replace the first
VTK_STEREO_RED_BLUE (in the function
  vtkRenderWindow::vtkRenderWindow()) by VTK_STEREO_CRYSTAL_EYES

I use PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES and all mine build with PV2 and 
PV3 without any changes. What's causing you trouble?

The variables
PARAVIEW_VERSION_MAJOR

should be available for you to use.

That should work fine.

I'm not clear on those questions?  You can have any number of server manager 
xml files.  You can have any number of xml files to define readers & writers 
for the gui (which defines file extensions and such).
The gui xml for defining how properties show up in the gui is not how we do it 
anymore.  You can let the gui auto generate it from the server manager xml.  
The server manager xml has been enhanced to include a few things that used to 
be in the gui xml in 2.x (such as labels).  If you're not satisfied, then 
plugins is currently the only way to change that.

When I try to use it by clicking on it it always makes surface I am trying to
visualize invisible even though
I have saved it with the use lookmark's camera settings checked. I think this is
a bug. I find this behavior exists
in both 3.0.1 and the current development version.

I did that also and things seemed to compile fine, BUT when I run  
paraview, my reader does not show up as a filter when I try to open a  
file. Selecting a file anyways then pops up a Dialog that lists the  
readers. My reader does not show up.

That is the first problem.

The second problem is that the Animation seems to not be working in  
the cvs version that I checked out yesterday. Anyone else seen this?

I can supply my XML files if that will help someone figure out what  
the problem is. I would like to NOT change anything or at least make  
the minimal changes so that I can compile my sources under both PV 2  
and PV3.

I have PV3, but my "super computer" location only have PV 2. Which is  
why I want the dual capability.

ParaView CVS is going through some big changes. I would not use it. If
you want something more stable, check out ParaView as of 2 days ago or
so.

Oh.. aint that fun.. Clinton put in a fix to compile against Qt  
Frameworks into the PV3 cvs, which is why I was using the cvs from  
late yesterday.

I guess I'll punt back to Qt 4.3 compiled as Shared Libs and checkout  
ParaView 3.0.1 from CVS. I think will hold me over till the next  
stable release of ParaView.

Clinton:
    What were the changes you did to get PV3 to compile against Qt  
Frameworks.?

The fixes _are_ in the 3.0 branch too.

Mike

Qt/Components/Resources/XML/ParaViewFilters.xml and ParaViewReaders.xml

if you build 'internal' - ie use the extra external modules (ironic 
groan), then you also need to modify the files above. Probably you can 
include a qrc file to do the same, but I haven't tried that.

I just remembered that you might have issues with the filename/string 
things mentioned a few days ago. I am not really using pv2.x any more so 
I may have fibbed when I said all my modules work with both - I haven't 
tried for a while.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems in running parallel scripts through pvpython
Message-ID: <20070622135507.25601.qmail@f5mail16.rediffmail.com>

I have some very fundamentel doubts regarding paraview and its working
in parallel.

1. Is it necessary to compile Paraview 3.0.1 from sources in parallel
to use paraview in parallel, if the binaries are available on n
different machines will it do the same job ?

2. I am able to launch pvserver (from the binaries not the compiled
sources) on 3 different computers using LAM/MPI, is it necessary that
the computer on which paraview's client will be launched should also
be within these 3 computer, which were booted through mpirun. If no
how should I connect to the 3 different severs from paraview ?

In the ParaView book it is said that if separate data and render
servers are running on 2 different clusters (Data Server/ Render
Server / Client configuration ) the client should connect to the
master node (or node 0) of both the data server and render server and
they in turn will connect to the other computers of their respective
servers.

Nothing is said how to connect when paraview is running in
Client/Server Mode. Should we connect to the master node of the server
and the other computers in the server will be controlled by the master
computer all by itself ? Or we have to do thing on over own ? 

Through GUI we can connect to only one server at a time. If we are
connected to one server and then connect to a second server the
connection to the first server is automatically closes.  

3. How to connect pvpython to server ? No command line argument seems
to be available with pvpython to connect to a running server. Should
we use paraview's active connection to connect to a particular server,
ex. paraview.ActiveConnection = paraview.Connect("10.101.11.71", 11111)
through script. 

If I try to connect pvpython to a pvserver through script the script
crashes

I had similar doubt which I posted on the mailing list and got a reply
from Utkarsh Ayachit. As suggested by Utkarsh Ayachit in paraview
mailing list, Vol 38, Issue 32 a similar script fails in the same
manner. Utkarsh wrote:-
"The Distributed stand-alone mode as described in the ParaView book is
no longer supported by ParaView i.e. to run in parallel, one must run in
client-server mode. This isn't that cumbersome really,
instead of"
  mpirun -np 4 paraview
we do
  mpirun -np 4 pvserver
  paraview (and then connect to the correct server).

Same is true for pvpython.

Here's script to read a file and then render in parallel.

import paraview
# Create default built in connection
paraview.ActiveConnection = paraview.Connect("localhost",11111);

# Create the reader proxy.
# Note that one must create the correct reader based on the type of the
# file being read.
reader = paraview.CreateProxy("sources", "ExodusReader", "sources")
reader.SetFileName("/tmp/somedataset.ex2")
reader.UpdateVTKObjects()

# Create render window
renWin = paraview.CreateRenderWindow()
# Till the view to always render on all processess in parallel and then
# composite the image together.
renWin.SetRemoteRenderThreshold(0);
renWin.UpdateVTKObjects();

# create and add display
display = paraview.CreateDisplay(reader, renWin)
# render
renWin.ResetCamera()
renWin.StillRender()

I ran mpirun on 3 computers including the computer on which I started the pvpython and tried a similar script as suggested in reply
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# test5.py
import paraview

paraview.ActiveConnection = paraview.Connect("localhost", 11111)

reader = paraview.CreateProxy("sources", "XMLUnstructuredGridReader", "sources")
reader.SetFileName("fire_ug.vtu")
reader.UpdateVTKObjects()

isosurface_filter = paraview.CreateProxy("filters", "Contour", "filters")
isosurface_filter.SetInput(reader)
isosurface_filter.SetContourValues(298.38, 396.84, 495.31, 593.775, 692)
isosurface_filter.UpdateVTKObjects()

renWin = paraview.CreateRenderWindow()
renWin.SetRemoteRenderThreshold(0)
renWin.UpdateVTKObjects()

display1 = paraview.CreateDisplay(isosurface_filter, renWin)

renWin.ResetCamera()
renWin.StillRender()
raw_input("Enter")      

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Again this resulted in a crash

4. Who does D3 filter work in ParaView3, is its working same as it was
in the previous version 2.X

I may be missing something very fundamental, can someone please help
me with this.

Yes.
ParaView's server executables require MPI to run in parallel and there are
many different implementations of MPI. For this reason the binaries are
compiled without MPI support. So to run paraview with a parallel server you
must compile paraview from source and enable MPI.

No the client can be on a different machine which may have a completely
different architecture. The server is conceptually one program with
different parts running on different machines. Start it with a command like
"mpirun -np NUMMACHINES pvserver". Then establish one connection between the
client and the server through the File->Choose Server dialog. Enter in the
machine name of the machine that you run the server on, and then optionally
give it a command line to start the server automatically instead of from the
command line manually.

In the ParaView book it is said that if separate data and render

Yes just connect to the first node of the server (or renderserver and
dataserver) by giving the Choose Server dialog their machine names, and the
servers will take care of themselved through MPI.

This is an artifact of not having your server built with MPI.

Yes.

I am not sure why this crashes for you. Recently there was a bug in creating
displays through pvpython, and we have been doing a great deal of work on
the display architecture in general. If the problem continues after you get
a parallel build built, send another email to the list and we'll try to help
diagnose.

Subject: [Paraview] Lam mpi + paraview
Message-ID: <b45d6a1e0706220825t58c4bdc7k62545a0e197c4685@mail.gmail.com>

I have compiled paraview with mpi support using lam. I changed the standard
c and c++ compilers for paraview too mpicc and mpic++ so that all the
mpi references where aviable. The build was correctly compiled, the problem
comes when trying to launch the standalone version of paraview.

When launching /bin/paraview the error i get is "Floating point exception",
using gdb to trace the error I get
  New process 16350]

 Program received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.
 0x05761ac6 in ?? ()

Now if I try to run /bin/paraview with mpirun -np 1, it tells me that
paraview  did not invoke MPI_INIT before quitting. The problem seems to only

happen with standalone version, as /bin/pvserver runs perfectly fine with
mpirun

In 3.0 the paraview executable is not MPI parallel, only the server
executables are.
That is, you can no longer run "mpirun -np N paraview" but instead have to
do something like "mpirun -np N pvserver&; paraview" and then use
File->Choose Server to connect to the parallel server.

Yes i understand I have to link to the server in MPI now, but as my first
email stated, by I trying running the client now that I compiled mpi support
in, I get a runtime floating point exception before paraview launches.

Can you send a stack trace for the floating point exception?

the backtrace seems really short to me, I did compile paraview with the
Debug flag.

Program received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.
0x03d79ac6 in ?? ()
(gdb) backtrace
#0  0x03d79ac6 in ?? ()
#1  0x00000000 in ?? ()

That is odd.

I have a feeling that lam's mpicc brings in or leaves out something
important in the compilation and linking, especially when it compiles the
non parallel paraview app. When compiling against MPICH for example we don't
use MPICH's mpicc. But instead use normal cc and link in the extra
libraries. Instead of setting the compiler directly, have you tried just
turning on PARAVIEW_USE_MPI and then setting the MPI_INCLUDE_PATH and
MPI_LIBRARY instead?

cheers
Dave

My first attempt at getting MPI working with paraview was by using the
default compiler and setting the MPI_INCLUDE_PATH and MPI_LIBRARY paths. The
problem I was running into was that I was getting underfined references when
linking the mpi libraries. The solution that Lam recommended was to use
their compiler to solve the library problems. If somebody could send me
their MPI_INCLUDE_PATH and MPI_LIBRARY configurations it would help me out
alot.

The output of mpicc --compile_info and mpicc -link_info and mpicc -show
should show them.

Do not use mpicc and mpic++ to compile paraview. Instead, configure
the build such that the necessary mpi libraries are used and the
appropriate include paths are set. mpicc and mpic++ are light wrappers
around the actual compilers that do "extra stuff". If you use them to
compile paraview, they do that "extra stuff" to every single object
file they compile. Since there is a good chunk of code that do not use
MPI, it is best to avoid doing that.

I'm using Paraview 2.6, and here are the configuration options for 
compilers and mpi.  If you want to see more of my configuration, let me 
know.  I spent quite awhile messing around with these, especially to get 
distcc workking (our cluster contains lots of 7 year old nodes... only 
together do they actually have notable computing power, and compiling on 
one node would've taken forever). One important thing was that this did 
NOT compile correctly with the new gcc that we have (gcc-4.2 I believe) so 
we used the older one.

//C compiler.
CMAKE_C_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/distcc/bin/gcc-3.4
[ which is linked to the normal distcc, with the "gcc-3.4" binary in our 
PATH ]

//CXX compiler.
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/distcc/bin/g++-3.4
[ which is linked to the normal distcc, with the "g++-3.4" binary in our 
PATH ]

//If a second mpi library is necessary, specify it here.
MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/libmpi++.so
//Path to a file.
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/local/mpich/1.2.5.2/gnu/include
//Path to a library.
MPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/libmpi.so
[ CMake figured these out on its own. We compiled and installed our own 
mpich, not (mpich-)mpd. ]

Hope this helps,
~Kyle

Thank you very much for the help, I am going to try to reconfigure my
paraview mpi build to use the standard compilers, and use the mpi library
path. I will report if I have any other problems

Dear all,
I have different sets of *.vtk files for each time steps (Finite Element
Data with unstructured grids). Is it possible to animate  these data with
Paraview?  I would greatly appreciate any help/suggestions.

Hi,

[PROBLEM -----------------------------------------------------------]

When I try to build vtkCSCSPointSprites as a PV module I obtain the
following error:

[ 76%] Building CXX object
Servers/Filters/Testing/Cxx/CMakeFiles/ServersFiltersPrintSelf.dir/ServersFiltersPrintSelf.o

I checked vtkCSCS/vtkPointSprites/CMakeLists.txt and it seems it already
includes the library:

IF(WIN32)
  SET(vtkCSCSPointSprites_EXTRA_LIBS "Glu32")
ELSE(WIN32)
  SET(vtkCSCSPointSprites_EXTRA_LIBS "GLU")

What am I doing wrong?

me other ideas

[CONTEXT - may be someone can give me other ideas -------------]

I need a fast visualization to direct volume render a "set of
voxels" (set of coordinates and density values, with no order).

First, I took a look into vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeRayCastMapper but it
naturally seems to be too slow.

Then, I though about using a "volume splatting" algorithm, in which
voxels are "splatted into a 2D image" using Gaussian splat kernels
(nothing to do with the vtkGaussianSplatter which splats them into a 3D
volume).

As far as I could learn (here are my notes on vtk/PV
http://namaste.maia.ub.es/public/vtk-volume-rendering-tutorial.pdf ), I
need to develop a Mapper. I was looking for something similar and I
found a post (http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-plot-3d-points-p6950717.html)
talking about vtkCSCSPointSprites.

I know vtkCSCSPointSprites is not exactly what I need, but it could be a
great basis to know how to build my own filter. In fact, I need to
project the voxels as GPU point sprites.

Currently I'm trying to run vtkCSCSPointSprites, but I can not build it.

1) The point sprite module is not 'paraview friendly' - paraview uses a
complicated layer of proxy objects to convert GUI issued calls into
server side renders. Adding the point sprite mapper to paraview is
something I have done - and am doing all over again now that the
representation/view strategy has taken over from the
display/rendermodule one. I hope eventually to be able to produce a
reasonably simple 'plugin' that 'normal' <cough> people can use directly
inside paraview. But right now, that seems a way off.

2) The dependency on GLU is an error. I have been making a lot of tweaks
on the SVN head branch of the point sprite code to support direct
rendering of SPH kernels. At the moment, the code is a spaghetti-like
mess of nonsense which sadly only I am likely to be able to make sense
of. The GLU code was used for testing the rendering into framebuffer
stuff and is obsolete.

I am planning on removing all the SPH code and returning the
spritemapper to a clean state. I can let you know when I've done this if
you wish.

As for paraview integration. I would avoid holding your breath and
waiting for a module, but if you are in desperate need of the GPU/sprite
rendering, please contact me off list and I'll see what I can do.

I finnished compiling Lam support into paraview, using the standard
compilers (gcc), and using the MPI_Library
properties. The problem is that i still continue to get floating point
exceptions when trying to start the standalone version of paraview that was
compiled with mpi support. Currently my work around is to keep two seperate
build directories, but this is not a solution I would like.

A back trace again shows nothing, so I have no idea if this is a problem
with Lam or Paraview.

What I do is have a perl script generate a pvd file, which can then be
opened in paraview.  The pvd file is a very simple xml file which
basically lists the vtk files.  Here is some perl:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

$DATA = "/path/to/datadir";
$ls = `ls -tr $DATA`;

@files = split(/\n/,$ls);

$i = 0;

open(VELOOUT, ">$DATA/velo.pvd");

print VELOOUT "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n";
print VELOOUT "<VTKFile type=\"Collection\" version=\"0.1\">\n";
print VELOOUT "  <Collection>\n";

foreach $file (@files) {
    if ($file=~/velo.*.vtk/) {
        print VELOOUT "    <DataSet timestep=\"$i\" group=\"\" part=\"0
\"\n";
        print VELOOUT "             file=\"$DATA/$file\" />\n";
        $i = $i+1;
    }
}

print VELOOUT "  </Collection>\n";
print VELOOUT "</VTKFile>\n";

##################################################


So basically, in the data directory I have a bunch of files representing
the timesteps as velo000000000.vtu, velo000000001.vtu, etc.  This file
creates a pvd file from them.

I am afraid it is not possible to point to .vtk files from a .pvd
file. A pvd file can only point to .vtX files (X being s, i, p, u
...). We are working on adding  the time series animation support to
ParaView 3 now. It will be in 3.2 (to be release at the end of
summer).

Perhaps time would be better spent writing a very simple vtk to vtk* 
command line utility that could be compiled as part of the test suite 
and integrated into the script posted earlier

vtkDataSetReader->SetFileName
Update
GetOutput()

switch type
case : write XML poly
case : write XML image

for each vtk file

Ignore this comment. I see now that a generic wrapper would handle more 
than just vtk files and allow any of the existing readers to handle 
*.001.*, *.002.* type of patterns

John,

This sounds like a bug in VTK. I will investigate it in the future. By
the way, VTK does have a 9-node quad. It is called
VTK_BIQUADRATIC_QUAD and it's type id is 28. See attached document. I
don't exactly know when these cells made their way into VTK but I know
they are in ParaView 3.

Hi John,

Thanks for your fast and concise answer.

As you said that the "glu" code was "deprecated", I commented it and I
finally could test the PointSprites with VTK
(http://namaste.maia.ub.es/public/vtk-volume-rendering-tutorial.pdf
pages 83-88 and 142).

I'm very glad with the implementation response time, and I think we can
use it as a basis to port the Volume Splatting algorithm
( http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~mueller/research/volvis.html ) to VTK for
research purposes (and maybe for performance, at least when
interacting). Thanks to the CSCS job!

Right now my plans are:

     1. Solving minor issues about vtkPointSpritesMapper
             1. Cleaning: you said, you had planned to clean it. So, I
                could wait the "code cleaning" before continue working
                on it.
             2. Resource dir: I left the resource dir setting in blank,
                because even if I set it to the correct path, I obtain
                an "vtkXMLShader (0x806cd58): Failed to locate file
                *.glsl". It seems it founds correctly the *.xml, but
                afterwards I need to be in the resources directory to
                let it find the *.glsl
     2. Adapting the current vtkPointSpritesMapper to some kind of
        vtkVolumeSplattingMapper
             1. Splatting "sets of voxels": could be done with the
                current PolyData container, but
                     1. Use color/opacity transfer functions instead of
                        Elevation
             2. Splatting "image data": think about the mapper
                adaptation.
     3. Creating a Paraview plugin
             1. I'm just entering into Paraview arquitecture (I left my
                notes in the tutorial I mentioned before); but I would
                be interested in helping to create the Paraview plugin.

So, if it is possible to join some efforts with other "Volume Splatting
interested people", it would be great.

Regards! and thanks for your attention,

Andreas,

This should be fixed in cvs head. Please try it again when the next
development snapshot comes out in a few weeks.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView & MPI Question(s)
Message-ID: <200706251441.43976.ttelford.groups@gmail.com>

I hope this is a quick question:
What requirements are there for using ParaView with MPI?  (ie. MPI 2, etc)

I've been successful in compiling ParaView (and VTK) using a couple MPI 
implementations (Open MPI, for example), but not others, such as MVAPICH2.

Unfortunately, I don't get the luxury of saying "Use this MPI" to my users, so 
I'm mainly interested in eliminating MPI implementations which don't have the 
features required by ParaView.

Also -- I noticed that you can configure the command used to execute 'mpirun' 
using CMake.  (Things like the max number of nodes, etc).  Is the node count 
something that is determined only at compile time, or is it configurable 
afterwards?

Troy,

ParaView requires very basic MPI support, all in MPI 1 standard. If
ParaView failed to compile with an MPI implementation, I am guessing
this is not because ParaView is using an MPI feature that is not
available. So far, I compiled ParaView with mpich (1 and 2), lampi,
lam/mpi, openmpi, vendor specific mpis etc... You can find almost all
MPI calls made by ParaView in VTK/Parallel/vtkMPICommunicator.cxx in
the source. There are a few more in vtkMPIController.cxx and
vtkMPIGroup.cxx. It is possible to compile hdf5 with MPI/IO support
but I don't think it is on by default. If it is, it shouldn't be hard
to by-pass it.

The MPI related parameters that are available in the configuration,
such as maximum number of nodes, have nothing to do with how paraview
is run by the user, rather they are used by the standard test system
(ctest). I would ignore them unless you are running tests or setting
up a dashboard.

Subject: [Paraview] fundamental doubts and problems with ParaView3
Message-ID: <20070626073119.19404.qmail@f5mail16.rediffmail.com>

Some more fundamental doubts and problems with ParaView3 compiled
sources with LAM/MPI support.

When I start paraview pvserver on 1 machine
(hostname=ged/ip=10.101.11.71) and run a script through pvpython on
another machine (hostname=bean/ip=10.101.11.70) which connects itself
to the server there is no problem and the results are perfectly, the
script which I use is given below.

import paraview

paraview.ActiveConnection = paraview.Connect("10.101.11.71", 11111)

reader = paraview.CreateProxy("sources", "XMLUnstructuredGridReader", "sources")
reader.SetFileName("fire_ug.vtu")
reader.UpdateVTKObjects()

isosurface_filter = paraview.CreateProxy("filters", "Contour", "filters")
isosurface_filter.SetInput(reader)
isosurface_filter.SetContourValues(298.38, 396.84, 495.31, 593.775, 692)
isosurface_filter.UpdateVTKObjects()

outline_filter = paraview.CreateProxy("filters", "OutlineFilter", "filters")
pyproxy5 = paraview.pyProxy(outline_filter)
pyproxy5.SetInput(reader)

renWin = paraview.CreateRenderWindow()
renWin.SetRemoteRenderThreshold(0)
renWin.UpdateVTKObjects()

display1 = paraview.CreateDisplay(isosurface_filter, renWin)
display2 = paraview.CreateDisplay(outline_filter, renWin)

renWin.ResetCamera()
renWin.StillRender()
raw_input("Enter")      

The problem is when I start the pvserver in parallel on 2 machines
(hostname=ged/ip=10.101.11.71) and (hostname=ender/ip=10.101.11.72)
with ged being the master node, and when I try to run a script through
pvpython on a different computer (hostname=bean/ip=10.101.11.70) the
script crashes. The output on the server end is :

The pvserver crashed as soon as I tried to creat the window

***************************************************************

The other doubt I have is, if in the second case described above
(pvserver running on 2 different computers(10.101.11.71 &
10.101.11.72) and pvpython running on another(10.101.11.70)) I run the
same script, how should I make the ActiveConnection. On the client
side the script should be connecting the the master node on the
pvserver ("10.101.11.71") in this case, but the scripts on the server
side, I suppose they should just connect to the "localhost". Am I
correct or making some mistake ?

********************************************************************

I finished compiling paraview with mpisupport, using the standard
compilers (gcc), and LAM/MPI. The problem is that i still continue to
get floating point exceptions when trying to start the stand-alone
version of paraview that was compiled with mpi support.

I have checked out the sources from cvs and tried to build Paraview3
two days ago there was absolutely no error during the installation but
when I try to launch the stand-alone version of paraview that was
complied with mpi support it raises an error:

raashid@bean:~/ParaView3-unix/bin$ ./paraview 
Floating point exception (core dumped)

The hardware configuration of the computer is Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz,
2GB DDR2 RAM and NVidia 7600 graphics card. The system runs on Ubuntu
7.04.

I have build the ParaView3 with debug symbol on and I compiled the
sources to support parallel processing through LAM. Version of LAM
installed is 7.1.2-1

I'll let you know when it is clean. Won't take long to do, but I have 
other things to finish first.

NB. The resource dir is used by the sprite render to fetch the textuer, 
but when in GLSL mode, you have to pick up the shaders. Look at the 
tests and see that at the start they set an environment var which is 
then picked up in vtkXMLShader or somewhere - this makes sure the xml 
code gets the correct resource dir. I should have documented the 
difference. - but now I've done it :)

I have the mapper running in ParaView CVS head. I will have a think 
about how to make a plug-in - or at least a distribution that is 
reasonably self contained..
I welcome help....The learning curve for PV internals is quite steep - 
you will want to invest some time in it.

Message-ID: <a641c8a30706261028p759ee94fm831339bc74146596@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,



I need to know how Paraview updates objects. I mean, for example, I'm
modifiying

vtkPVVolumeAppearanceEditor::VolumePropertyInternalCallback( )

to get some info I need to render volumes, and need to pass it to the
mapper. I created a new class that stores this info, and added it to the
mapper, so now I want to now how ParaView does a
"mapper->SetMyClass(vtkMyClass* myClass);"

I know vtkPVVolumeAppearanceEditor::VolumePropertyInternalCallback( ) calls
vtkSMProxy::UpdateVTKObjects(), but I don't get the idea.

Can anyone explain this to me or give me some hints??


Thanks

Thanks, Berk. I'm glad to hear support for time series animation will be 
back soon. By the way, will the legacy VTK format continue to be 
supported in the future? Are there any plans for phasing it out?

We have no plans to phase out legacy VTK format. Despite the fact that
we call it legacy :-) We should call it 'VTK format that is so 1984".

Hi Bryan,

I finally got around to looking at this but the file is gone. I am
guessing with the latest changes we have, this is now fixed on cvs
head but I would like to try it. Can I get the file again?

Hi John,

     1. Solving minor issues about vtkPointSpritesMapper
             1. Cleaning: OK, I wait... thanks!
             2. Resource dir: Understood, I corrected my examples.
             3. Python wrapping:
                      * I updated CMakeList.txt to generate the Python
                        wrapper and translated the example into Python
                        language (it will be easier to test, and at the
                        end I will convert it back to Cxx). [the files
                        are listed below #1 and #2]
     2. vtkVolumeSplattingMapper
             1. Splatting "sets of voxels": trying to use ColorLUT
                     1. I tried to use a ColorLUT without success, I
                        attach the file below #3. What am I doing wrong?
             2. Splatting "image data": to be solve after the previous
                issue.
     3. Creating a Paraview plugin:
              * I'm interested in investing some time with Paraview, so
                if you send me the current PV-attached-code I could try
                to start deriving a plugin. At least, I can try to
                "prepare it" and ask for help.
              * I'm suggesting my research group to migrate to VTK
                +Paraview, so I should learn as much as possible ;)

The following listed files are below:
- 1 CMakeList.txt to generate Python wrapper
- 2 Python example
- 3 Trying to use a ColorLUT

Thanks one more time,

jor;)i

PS: I still send copies to both list in case anybody else is interested
in something similar. In the other hand, when one start facing VTK, one
appreciates each "piece" of code found in forum messages, specially in
python ;)

Hello,

I think it would be useful to allow loading a default set of plugins on startup.
It is rather
inconvenient to have to reload them manually each time one starts ParaView.

Set the PV_PLUGIN_PATH variable to your directory(ies) with plugins, and 
they'll all be loaded at startup.

I would like to write a Custom GUI for my Reader. One of the  
questions that I had is if it is possible to get feedback from the  
reader portion and populate something like a QTreeeView with data  
from the reader? Note, that I have not even started yet, just trying  
to get ideas together. I plan on looking at some of the examples  
again to see if there is anything that might answer my question? Are  
there any places in the ParaView 3 code base that does this so I can  
take a look?

Thanks for any help

Yes, it is possible.

A simpler example that might be sufficient for you is  
Qt/Components/pqExodusIIPanel.cxx

More complex interaction with a reader is done in pqExodusPanel.cxx and 
pqXDMFPanel.cxx

Subject: [Paraview] source code archives for 3.0.x releases
Message-ID: <46833B04.5040409@gmail.com>

Hello,

I was wondering if any source code archives have been made for the
latest stable 3.0.x releases. Currently, there are no links on the
download page at http://www.paraview.org/New/download.html.

Are there plans to make source code archives for the latest versions
available at some point or are people expected to check out the source
via CVS from now on?

I am asking this because I would like ParaView to remain relatively easy
to package and maintain on Gentoo Linux. Source code archives make the
job a lot simpler.

Thanks,
Tim

We can make archives of the source for paraview releases available. I
didn't intentionally stop making those, just didn't think of it. We'll
create source archives for future releases.

Subject: [Paraview] No scalars menu in gradient filter
Message-ID: <20070628155033.jsc0q1zuc3nocg0o@webmail5.kuleuven.be>

Hello,

In the manual about the 'gradient filter' in the 'Paraview Guide'(page  
187), three different menus are mentioned, which should specify the  
gradient to be calculated.  Namely: the "input" menu, which specifies  
the file, the "Scalars" menu, which specifies the scalar from which  
the gradient has to be calculated, and the "dimensionality" menu,  
which specifies the dimensionality in which the gradient needs to be  
calculated.

When using paraview 2.6, only 2 menus appear on the screen, the  
"scalars" menu is missing.  When applying this filter, the new file is  
exactly the same as the previous file.
When using paraview3.2 for exactly the same problem, the "scalars"  
menu appears on the screen, but when I select it, ParaView crashes  
with the error message: "segmentation fault".

I`m using the .vti AMR HierarchicalBoxDataSet format, with pointing to  
. vti ImageData files.
Anybody has some explanation for this behaviour or hints how to solve  
this problem?

Thanks in advance.
Best regards,
Peter

Message-ID: <E9921586-27D4-4B1B-9A21-2627D9F0154E@gmail.com>

I am writing a plugin for ParaView 3 and I am going with the idea of  
having ParaView 3 autogenerate the GUI for my Reader. (We are  
prototyping at this point).
    I need to retrieve a list of Strings from my Data File to display  
to the user so the user can then select one of those string values. I  
generally understand all the C++ code part. It is the Server Manager  
XML that I am getting hung up on. I have been reading through the  
ParaView book and looking through some of the XML files in ParaView 3  
source code. It would seem I need something like:

<StringVectorProperty
         name="PhaseName"
         command="GetPhaseList"
         information_only="1">
         <SimpleStringInformationHelper/>
      </StringVectorProperty>

I know I need some sort of Information Helper so something.. Could  
someone shed some light or point me to an example? Whether the list  
is in a popup or traditiional List box does not really matter. If it  
can ONLY be done with a list of 'ints' I could hack something  
together to make that work...

Thanks

I don't see an example that does exactly what you want.
But here's something that might work (untested).

<StringVectorProperty
        name="PhaseNameInfo"
        command="GetPhaseList"
        information_only="1">
        <StringArrayHelper/>
  </StringVectorProperty>

<StringVectorProperty
      name="PhaseName"
      command="SetPhase"
      number_of_elements="1">
     <StringListDomain name="operation">
        <RequiredProperties>
          <Property name="PhaseNameInfo" function="ArraySelection"/>
        </RequiredProperties>
     </StringListDomain>
</StringVectorProperty>

That's assuming your reader has a SetPhase function.
The PhaseNameInfo is used to get the list of available strings, by calling 
GetPhaseList which returns a vtkStringArray.
Note how the PhaseNameInfo is tied to the domain of the PhaseName property.
The PhaseName property is used to set the selection on the reader.
The GUI would give you a combo box to choose one string from a list.

StringArrayHelper is new and doesn't exist in 3.0.  You might be able to copy 
it from the CVS head, rename it and include it in your plugin.

This approach might be easier in the long run, as you'll have less code to 
maintain yourself.

Tim,

Thanks a lot for going through the trouble of maintaining ParaView in
portage! I had never even considered that it might be there, but I'll
definitely be making use of that in the future.

Message-ID: <004301c7ba47$e2ec4d90$0700a8c0@cod>

Hello,
 
I tried to check-out and compile the latest version of ParaView from the CVS
repository. The compilation went fine, but when I try to run it, it can't
find libQtPython.so. Is this part of ParaView, VTK or Qt? Copying the
library from a binary ParaView installation didn't work either, because it
is a 32bit library and my system is 64bit.
 
Thanks,
Oliver

Thanks for the hint. So I am trying what you suggested and I am not  
sure what "target" of ParaView these files should go with. I found  
vtkSMStringArrayHelper and vtkPVStringArrayHelper. I copied both into  
my source tree and added them to my sources in my  
ParaViewImport.cmake file. When I compile ParaView I get the following:

/Users/mjackson/Task_7/MXA_Workspace/PVPhaseField/src/vtk/ 
vtkSMStringArrayHelper.cxx:20:39: error: vtkSMInformationHelper.h: No  
such file or directory
/Users/mjackson/Task_7/MXA_Workspace/PVPhaseField/src/vtk/ 
vtkSMStringArrayHelper.cxx:20:39: error: vtkSMStringVectorProperty.h:  
No such file or directory
.
.
.

So I am guessing that I simply do not have these sources assigned to  
the proper target> Here is my ParaViewImport.cmake file:

# specify the name of the module
SET(MODULE_NAME PVPhaseField)

# specify the sources that should be wrapped

Try adding the helper with the macro
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SERVERMANAGER_SOURCES
instead of 
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_WRAPPED_SOURCES

so the helper is built as part of the server manager instead of filters.

Hi Martin,

Sorry to start a new thread, but I was deregistered when you posted.

> Can Paraview handle the 'undef' keyword in Ensight Gold variable
> files?

I too looked at this and found that 'undef' is handled in the ASCII format,
but not in the binary format. This could the source of your problem.
Fortunately, a small hack to the binary reader should not be too difficult
to add.

Another problem might arise if you have polyhedral cells (Ensight: nfaced
elements). In this case, you can reckon with receiving a segfault. The only
quick hack here would be to have the readers silently jump over these data
and leave holes instead.

There have been sporadic discussions in the past about supporting a new cell
type - the last posting was last year
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/vtk-developers/2006-April/004157.html ,
but I haven't seen anything more recent.

I started toying with the idea of targeting the vtk formats directly
(instead of worrying about any weaknesses in the Ensight reader), but
without polyhedral support there really is no point bothering.

It would be interesting to hear opinions about how much work would be
involved with adding a new polyhedral cell type to VTK.
If nothing else, it would have the advantage of being the last new element
type for a while.

Cheers,

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.0.2 crashes when trying to connect to a
	server. A bug?
Message-ID: <200706291743.l5THhRDe002046@apex.ibpc.fr>


Hi,

I am using paraview 3.0.2 (which I have recompiled with openmpi) and 
try to get parallel rendering to work. When I try to connect to a 
server from within paraview, it crashes.

I have tried several things (with the same crash as result):

- start the "pvserver" server manually, either using mpi or not, using
  --use-offscreen-rendering or not

- start the server from within paraview using something like
  /sw/bin/om-mpirun -np 4 /opt/bin/pvserver -sp=$PV_SERVER_PORT$ --use-offscreen-rendering

- use the paraview binary from the kitware site, start it's packaged 
  pvserver manually and try to connect to it (just to check whether 
  connecting works in general and leaving mpi for a second step)

As server "configurations" I have tried
- client/server with/without reverse connection
- Host, either the localhost, the IP address or the hostname


What am I missing? According to [1] it should be as simple as this, 
shouldn't it. Maybe a bug?


Some details about the setup here:
Paraview CVS branch "ParaView-3-0-2", recompiled against fink's openmpi 
implementation using cmake 2.4.6 on Mac OSX Tiger/intel.

Thanks in advance,
  Marc Baaden

Yes, it really should be as simple as that.  Can you give more
information about the crash?  Was there any output before it happened?
Can you give us a stack trace?

Message-ID: <43a689850706291222x3efe25dclf7e56b3d48732d1d@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to compile ParaView 3 from CVS (checked out today) and I
am receiving the following errors during linking:

Linking CXX shared library ../../bin/libpqWidgets.dylib
ld: Undefined symbols:
_HIViewGetWindow
_HIViewSetNeedsDisplay
_HIWindowFlush
/usr/bin/libtool: internal link edit command failed
make[2]: *** [bin/libpqWidgets.dylib] Error 1
make[1]: *** [Qt/Widgets/CMakeFiles/pqWidgets.dir/all] Error 2

This is on OS X 10.4.10 Intel. We are also having some problems
compiling on Windows XP. Could some suggest a stable, known working
branch of ParaView to work from?

I really need the multiple render window support of ParaView 3 so
going back to ParaView 2.x is not a possibility any more.

I understand PV3 CVS is in a giant state of flux at the moment, but
were there any stable branches?

I see there is a PV 3.0.2 release? What branch should I look for in
CVS? What about 3.0.1 or 3.0.0?


Thanks for any help or suggestions.

The CVS tags are ParaView-3-0-2, ParaView-3-0-1, and ParaView-3-0-0, 
respectively. Or to just get the ParaView 3.0 branch (from which all 
ParaView 3.0.* releases are made), use the ParaView-3-0 tag.

(Recall: the problem was for paraview 3 client that crashes when 
connecting to any other server than builtin)

Ok, I have some more info.

I tried the same (copied the compiled binaries) on another machine. 
Here it works fine. I can also connect from this machine to the machine 
that I tried previously and that crashes when the client is run locally
(now only running the pvserver).

So the problem seems to be with the paraview.app client running on the 
machine that I tested first. The one thing that is different on this 
machine is that it is behind a firewall and has a proxy set up. Could 
that have something to do with it?

I can try and get some more info on the crash (stack trace or the like) 
next week, but for now I can only access the machine remotely and thus 
not start the client. [how do you do stack traces on the mac with an 
XXX.app executable?] The only 'debug' output I had so far was a segmentation 
fault, when trying to run either of
1) pvTestDriver --run-test-init=/opt/paraview-cvs/Applications/Client/Testing/Cxx/ManualConnectCS.xml
2) pvTestDriver --run-test-init=/opt/paraview-cvs/Applications/Client/Testing/Cxx/ManualConnectCRSDS.xml

Some other 'issues' or observations:
- when I start pvserver with eg -np 4, I only have 3 pvserver tasks 
running at about 99%, and occasionnally a 4th at ~20%. Is that to be 
expected?
- there seem to be some artefacts for eg Volume Rendering or Points 
representation (presumably at the boundaries of the rendered sub-images).
Can these artefacts be avoided or corrected for?
- is it possible to 'reload' sessions that were saved previously with 
the builtin server using another server setting? If I try and do so for 
eg a saved state file, it closes the server connection and starts up a 
builtin server..

Thanks very much in advance,
Marc

Hi Mark,

In ASCII format the file is read correctly, but I think the nodes with 
undefined values are not displayed the way they should. In fact, I don't see 
how the 'undef' keyword changes the displayed data at all.
I attached an example to show what I mean. The central node should have an 
undefined value, but its value is displayed just like that of any other node.

Unfortunately I don't know anything about VTK or how easy it is to add new 
cell types, so I can't help you there.

Regards,
Martin

None of these point release are compiling for one reason or another.  
I am not trying to be a pain here but is there a ParaView 3 Version  
that will build cleanly on OS X 10.4.9 Intel, with CMake 2.4.6, Qt  
4.3.0 and Xcode 2.4.1?

According to recent emails to this list the ParaView 3 branch is  
going through major changes so I am guess that this is NOT a good  
time to just be using some random snapshot from the ParaView 3 CVS.

Here are the problems I am having with the 3.0.0, 3.0.1 and 3.0.2  
checkpoints.
Most will not find Qt correctly.
Most will have link problems when building the pqWidgets library
Most will NOT build the ParaView.app package anymore.

I kludged the CMakeLists.txt file to add the Carbon/Application  
Services/QuickTime libraries to the pqWidgets Library. This at least  
allowed the compile to finish. But there is NO ParaView.app package  
created? This may be related to a request to still be able to build  
ParaView 3 as a NON Bundled app on OS X? Don't know.

Again, not trying to be a pain, just trying to do some development  
against PV 3 so we can move forward with our plugins for our client.

Thanks again for all the tremendous work that is put into PV3.

Subject: [Paraview] Cell data to point data filter not working for me on
	post 2.4 versions.
Message-ID: <000301c7bb80$aebc9130$0302a8c0@jonathanpc>

Hi,
 
I use the cell to point data filter quite frequently with no problems on the
older versions of paraview.  However, when I try the same thing on the newer
versions the data gets deleted and I'm left with nothing.
 
Is this a bug and is there any way around it?
 
Thanks,
 
Jonathan
