Hi,

	I've made a couple changes to get ParaView compiling and running on a
Linux Athlon64 box with VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS turned on. I checked in one
obvious CMake error, but there are a couple of issues I'm less certain
about, so I'm attaching a patch in the hopes someone will tell me the
correct way to go about fixing things:

1. I had to add some member functions to vtkClientServerStream because
it wasn't including a 64-bit type (long long int as opposed to long int
on gcc 3.3.2). Should I be explicitly adding these
	VTK_CLIENT_SERVER_OPERATOR(long long)
	VTK_CLIENT_SERVER_OPERATOR(unsigned long long)
	VTK_TYPE_FROM_NATIVE(long long,vtkTypeInt64);
	VTK_TYPE_FROM_NATIVE(unsigned long long,vtkTypeUInt64)
	VTK_CSS_GET_ARGUMENT(long long)
	VTK_CSS_GET_ARGUMENT(unsigned long long)
or is that what the VTK_TYPE_INT64_NOT_STANDARD ifdef is supposed to
catch and it's just not being configured correctly? (I'm pretty sure
that just checking in the patch below will break builds on other systems
where sizeof(long) == sizeof(long long) or long long doesn't exist.

2. Is the patch below for handling a system-provided libz OK or will it
break other platforms?

3. The MPI library I used (from www.lam-mpi.org) defines
MPI_LONG_LONG_INT, not MPI_LONG_LONG (it appears that the MPI 1.1
standard calls out MPI_LONG_LONG_INT while MPI 2 calls out
MPI_LONG_LONG). This breaks the compile of
VTK/Parallel/vtkMPICommunicator.cxx. I haven't included a patch... I
just edited my mpi.h file, but it seems like we should check that one of
the two is defined (assuming all MPI implementations use macros to
define the constants).

	Thanks for any help,
	David

As you guessed, this change will break elsewhere, but a modified version 
may be needed.  Exactly one of the following should be true:

   - sizeof(long) == 8
   - VTK_TYPE_INT64_NOT_STANDARD is defined

I suspect that the problem is that the type "long" is really 64-bit, but 
vtkIdType is defined to "long long", which is also 64-bit.  Since "long" 
provides the 64-bit type for vtkClientServerStream, it doesn't bother 
adding the "long long" overloads.  Then code that uses vtkIdType breaks. 
  I'll work on fixing this case soon.

Someone else will have to comment on your other two questions.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview and scripts for time-dependent data
Message-ID: <40716018.C61D37D5@sophia.inria.fr>

I have say 200 sets of data each at a different time step. To simplfy
things let's say I have 8 time steps of data. I put the file names in
two input files.

file1.inp

'time1.vtk'

file2.inp

'time7.vtk'
'time8.vtk'

I want to process these file using two cpus taking advantage of the fact
that they are independent and can be done in any order.
I want to write a script such that process 0 reads and processes
sequential the four files in file1.inp and processor 1 reads
and processes the four files in file2.inp.

Question is how do I write a script that will do this?

I've committed a fix, but I'm unable to test it.  Please update 
Utilities/VTKClientServer and try the build again.  Be sure to remove 
your changes or you'll get conflicts when you update.

Hi Stephen

I am assuming you downloaded the binaries.

Perhaps it is better if you got the source and build it on your own 
machine.

Subject: [Paraview] XML file name question
Message-ID: <3165.128.165.144.120.1081207965.squirrel@webmail5.pair.com>

I have a question about the file extension conventions for VTK XML files.

Each data type and file type is paired with a particular file extension. 
What is the purpose of having different file extensions?  The 'type'
attribute of the root element (VTKFile) uniquely identifies the type of
data contained in the root element.  So, the file extension information is
redundant.  Also, why is the 'type' attribute needed on the root element? 
The name of the first subordinate element must correspond the the 'type'.

As I see it, there are three distinct items of information which all must
match but all provide the same information:

 * file extension
 * type attribute of root element
 * name of the first subordinate element

Wouldn't everything be simpler if only the third item were used?  What
would not work?

This is not criticism.  I'm simply curious.

thanks,
-robert

I have problem building my 3rd party projects with the new CVS nightly 
build architecture. After a fresh CVS update, I get the following error:

  Invocation of macro "VTK_WRAP_ClientServer" with incorrect number of 
arguments.

Can someone suggest the corrections to apply to the CMake code given 
above by Brad?

TIA.

Hi Robert,

The reason the file extensions are different is so that you know without 
opening the file what type of data it contains. You can determine what 
reader to use just by looking at the file extension. Yes, it's redundant 
information, but it seemed to make more sense than having the same file 
extension for files that contain completely different data set types. I 
wasn't particularly involved in the XML design for the VTK file format, so 
someone else will have to comment on the rest of your question.

If you can get it working from source, I would like to work with you to 
determine the difference between your build and the binary distribution. 
  Whatever the cause of the crash, I would like to fix it for the next 
release.

Thanks,

It seems to be related to the linux kernal which was recently upgraded
to

Red Hat Linux release 6.1 (Cartman)
Kernel 2.4.23 on an i686
from 2.4.17

In fact I spoke too quickly as 1.04 was ok but now gives 
Segmentation fault
as well

I will try a source installation and report back.

Subject: [Paraview] Showing reader-generated pipeline in selection window?
Message-ID: <407571E0.7000007@sandia.gov>

Hi all,
   I'd like to have my custom reader generate multiple outputs, which 
then get grouped using a group filter.  If I just implement that in the 
normal way in the reader code, will those outputs and group(s) show up 
in the paraview selection window?  If not, how would I go about making 
them show up?  I guess that's making the selection window more of a 
pipeline viewer - is that the intent of that window?

Thanks.

If you create a reader that produces multiple outputs, ParaView will
automatically group them together. You can then extract one or more
"parts" using Extract Parts. If you want the Extract Parts GUI display
special name for parts, change your reader so that it creates an
vtkUnsignedCharArray named "Name" and containing the name of the part
and adds it to data object's field data. For an example, see
vtkEnSight6Reader ::CreateUnstructuredGridOutput().

Hi,

paraview is really a great application !

but i found an error in batch mode i didn't understand. I read in
interactive mode an ensight file (there are some warnings during this
reading, i suppose they are due to second order elements i have in my
ensight files, the warning is :
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Warning in file:
/home/kitware/ParaViewReleaseRoot/paraview-1.2.1/VTK/IO/vtkEnSightGoldReader.cxx(1540)
 Only vertex nodes of this element will be read.
)
then i save the batch file toto.pvb (File/Save Batch Script) and i exit.
Finally i launch paraview in batch mode : > paraview -b toto.pvb. The error
appears :
Errors while exiting ParaView:
ERROR: In

Controller.

Where am i wrong ?

Thx

Hi all,

A question about the use of the GroupParts filter.

When I use a CleanUnstructuredGrid filter with a GroupParts dataset as 
input,
duplicate points are not removed correctly (the duplicate points between 
the 2 datasets).
Thus the 2 datasets with 4 hexahedrons each (64 points) used should be 
cleaned up to 30 points.
But I get  40 points.

I have put dataset exemple at:
http://dods.ipsl.jussieu.fr/brocksce/pv_bugs/groupparts/

Any idea. Bug or feature ?

Regards
Patrick

Question:
I must leave the pview window untouched or the image get whatever

I have 100 sets of data to process. running ParaView in the mpi mode
would be nice but I don't how to do this. Maybe I missed a users e-mail
to explain this, if so, a copy would be appreciated.

In the short term, mpi is not necessary as each data set is independent
of each other let each processor run ParaView processing the data
sequential (data set 1:15 go to process0r 0, 26-50 go processor 1,
...etc).
 Has anyone written a script that would send the data sets to the
different processors?

You haven't done anything wrong, but you've run into a bug in the 1.2 
release of ParaView. This problem has been corrected in the 1.4 version 
scheduled to be released early next month.

Hi Patrick,

This is actually the expected behavior in ParaView. The Group Parts filter 
does not merge the input data sets into a single data set, but instead 
groups the separate inputs so that a single filter can be applied to all of 
the parts at the same time. When you run the CleanUnstructuredGrid filter 
on the results of GroupParts, you are actually applying an instance of 
CleanUnstructuredGrid to each individual part. The instances of 
CleanUnstructuredGrid have no knowledge of each other, which would be 
necessary in order to merge points across datasets.

That said, this would be a feature request, not a bug. You could add it to 
the ParaView bug tracker (http://www.paraview.org/Bug/) and mark it as a 
feature request.

Hi Stephen,

Did you try the Offscreen option? It should solve your problem, and it is 
available in the dialog box that comes up after you choose a filename for 
saving the batch script.

Hi,

Is it possible to use with paraview the functionality described in the
ensight gold format regarding the "undefined variables" ? In my example it
doesn't work : not implemented or bug ?

Thanks !

PB

The EnSight gold reader in ParaView does not handle the undefined variables 
functionality.

Hello all,

how do I change the centre of rotation in parallel projection?

In perspective projection I can use the 'Pick center of rotation' button 
and click on a visible object and it will put the centre of rotation on 
the object as expected but this seems to behave differently in parallel 
projection mode.

Regards,

Mattijs

You can check the Bug Tracker and do a query. This is (was) a known 
problem, bug #600, which as been fixed on the CVS version. (You did not 
specify which version you are running)

Hi Mattijis,

This was a bug in the ParaView 1.2 release. It has been corrected for the 
1.4 release which should come out early next month.

I use a 3rd party data reader for CFX5 which works under the 
ParaView-1-4 version. I load my data, can save sessions, reload many 
sessions. All works well, except the batch-mode scripting.

I get the following error:

ERROR: In /local/apps/ParaView/GUI/Widgets/vtkKWApplication.cxx, line 1309
vtkPVApplication (0x8130740):
     Script:
/local/apps/ParaView/bin/bucker3.pvb
     Returned Error on line 24:
       invalid command name ""

Lines 1-24 of the script is included below:
Line 24 calls on the reader variable name.
Looks like it is empty. Is there another environment setting that needs 
to be done for batch execution of 3rd part readers? I tried the same 
with the EnSight reader and did not get an error. Looks like the 
$proxyManager needs to be made aware of the 3rd part readers. I have no 
clue where to look.

Thanks for the help

Subject: [Paraview] VTK Utility Library Mangling
Message-ID: <408D4F7D.4080005@kitware.com>

Hello,

The zlib, png, jpeg, tiff, and expat libraries in the VTK/Utilities 
directory now have all symbols mangled to begin with a vtk_ prefix. 
This will avoid conflicts when applications try to link against vtkIO 
and a system version of one of these libraries.

For some reason, Visual Studio .NET does not recognize that the header 
files for some of these libraries have changed and do not rebuild the 
.dll files for them.  If you get unresolved symbol errors for one of 
these libraries, just right-click on the library in the GUI and select 
"rebuild".  Then try your build again.

-Brad
