That's not possible currently. It has been captured in the bug
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=5988

This is currently only supported for exodus files. For all other types 
of files, you can open the file again and then reconnect all the filters 
connected to this new reader.

Hi Robert,

Generally speaking, it's recommended that users add a bug report for the 
bug fix/feature that they want committed to CVS and then attach the 
patch/new files/tar ball/zip as an attachment for the bug and indicate 
in the bug report that the fix has been attached.

Hi Luis,

ParaView server can be run in a mode where a group of processes are 
treated as "dataserver" while another group is treated as 
"renderserver". The dataserver does not perform any rendering and can be 
on those machines that don't have X. renderserver needs X or 
alternatively can be built with OSMesa in which case it does not need X.

To run in render server mode do the following

$ ./pvdataserver
$ ./pvrenderserver
$ ./paraview
Make sure that in the "Configure New Server" dialog when adding a new 
server connection to choose the "Client/Data Server/Render server" option.

As far as using CPU as GPU, I am guessing you are looking for software 
rendering. In that case build paraview with Mesa.

Hi,

There seems to be a small problem with picking the centre of rotation (not just because we spell it differently) when the point being picked is currently 'selected' and Point Labels are Visible. The picking normally snaps to points very well, but when picking a selected point and Labels are shown it doesn't seem to know what to snap to. The simple work-around is to temporarily turn off label visibility while doing the pick.

Subject: [Paraview] Opacity problem with Paraview 3.1/3.2
Message-ID: <472B8410.7060101@mcs.anl.gov>


We're seeing a problem with opacity with very basic models in Paraview 
3.1 and 3.2.  Using the stock cylinder source and setting the opacity to 
0.5, we're getting this:

    http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~turam/paraview/pv-snap01.jpg

Note that the opacity is applied to the polygons inconsistently.  When 
rotating the model, some opaque polygons become transparent, and 
transparent polygons become opaque.  When setting opacity to 0, the 
entire model becomes transparent. 

I found some seemingly related reports that reference bug 2347:

    http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=2347

which includes patches for 2.6 which have been applied in the 3.x code, 
and a later reference to more work that will be done.

Is this a known problem encountered by others?  Should we suspect a 
machine/graphics configuration problem?  Is it likely related to the 
proposed fixes in bug 2347?

Hi Tom,

I don't think bug 2347 is causing what you are observing. The whole
opacity thing is a long story but I will try to summarize it:

1) OpenGL requires polygons to be rendered in a sorted order (back to
front, http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/transparency.htm)
for correct transparency

2) By default, VTK does not render polygons in a sorted order because
sorting has to be done for each camera position and is potentially
very expensive for large models

3) VTK supports an algorithm called depth peeling
(http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Depth_Peeling) to deal with this issue.
This algorithm works fairly well for many cases

4) Depth peeling requires certain extensions that are not available on
all graphic cards

5) Transparency would work well if your card supports all extensions
listed here: http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Depth_Peeling. I believe the
latest version of Mesa also works.

You have a high-end nVidia and depth peeling should work on it. I will
see if we can figure out why it is not working. I have a colleague
with a 8 series card.

for example I see:

Cell ID

Now problem is that I want to save so many ID to my file quickly, how
can I do it?
 ( I don't want to save it by typing the id to a file one by one, also
I found I can not use
Ctrl + mouse left button to pick all id and paste them to my file)

In my experience, what makes that kind of error go away for that
particular version that comes with OpenFOAM is use the filter "Extract
Parts", select the "Internal mesh" there and apply the Plot Filter on
that.

PS: Maybe you should have mentioned where you got your version of
paraview from (OpenFOAM). It would help people to classify your
problem

Message-ID: <472F2976.5060204@users.sourceforge.net>

I've been playing with 3.2.0, and I must say it's looking good!

There's a small build problem with using FFMPEG shared libraries.  I get 
the following error:
[ 81%] Built target vtkSMExtractDocumentation
[ 81%] Creating Documentation for ParaViewSources
/home/ziegeler/paraview/build/3.2.0-nrl1-x86_64/bin/vtkSMExtractDocumentation-real:

make[1]: ***

I worked around it by symlinking the 3 appropriate libav*.so.* files 
into the build tree's bin directory.

In the Makefiles, I think symlinking (or copying) for the build process, 
or temporarily setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH, might be appropriate.  Although, 
I don't remember this being a problem for 3.1, but I may have not been 
using FFMPEG.  I had intended to at the time, but now I don't recall if 
I actually did.

Hi Sean,

This is a known "issue". I believe it is not a new one though. During
compilation, vtkSMExtractDocumentation is run to automatically
generate documentation. Unless it can resolve all libraries, it will
fail and stop the build. The best solution is to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
or put all libraries needed somewhere like /usr/lib.

Sorry, but I'm not exactly sure what question you are asking.  Do you
want to use ParaView to convert this back to dem format?  There is no
dem writer in VTK.  Someone will need to create one before ParaView is
able to write out dem files.

Hi Jack,

Are you just trying to see your data as a height field rather than as a 
2D image? If so, then once you have your image data loaded into 
ParaView, apply the "Clean to Grid" filter to it (to convert it to an 
unstructured grid), and then apply the "Warp (scalar)" filter to convert 
the scalar values to height.

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Qt Filter Panel
Message-ID: <b45d6a1e0711051010q878f5e7l422acccc4fbea369@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to make a custom UI panel based on the current Threshold panel.
So far I created the UI file and copied and modified the pq files for the
UI.

The problem is I get this error when loading the filter:

QObject::connect: Cannot connect (null)::valueChanged(double) to
SumBillboardPanel::upperChanged(double)
QObject::connect: Cannot connect (null)::valueChanged(double) to
SumBillboardPanel::lowerChanged(double)


Which references this section of my file:

pqSumBillboardPanel::pqSumBillboardPanel(pqProxy* pxy, QWidget* p) :
  pqLoadedFormObjectPanel("SumBillboard.ui", pxy, p)
{
  this->Lower = this->findChild<pqDoubleRangeWidget*>("ThresholdBetween_0");
  this->Upper = this->findChild<pqDoubleRangeWidget*>("ThresholdBetween_1");

   QObject::connect(this->Lower, SIGNAL(valueChanged(double)),
                    this, SLOT(lowerChanged(double)));
   QObject::connect(this->Upper, SIGNAL(valueChanged(double)),
                    this, SLOT(upperChanged(double)));

  this->linkServerManagerProperties();
}

Now I think the problem is that the UI file isn't being loaded properly, but
I have no clue why as everything is in the same directory and named
correctly. Does anybody have any tips on getting this to work?

You can call isValid() at the beginning of the constructor to verify your UI 
file loaded correctly.  If not, you're most likely missing the prefix path to 
it so it matches what you put in your .qrc file.

Or the ui file you created doesn't have a pqDoubleRangeWidget or it isn't 
named "ThresholdBetween_0".

Thanks for the help. I have found the problem being how it qt / paraview
handles relative paths. Instead of the file using the path for plugin .so
being the root, it actually uses the runtime directory as the root
directory. Which means if I launch paraview from  my home directory, or from
the bin exactly I get different expectations on where my UI file should
reside.

The solution to this seems to be that the paraview developers have used a
:/pqWidgets link to handle this problem, but I would like to know if there
is a away for me to set the relative path starting directory to where the
.so or the source code resides.

(The way i found this out, was i dumped absolute file paths using QFileInfo
inside pqLoadedFormObjectPanel )

The ":" as the first character to a filename means it is embedded.  I highly 
recommend you do the same and embed the ui file in your plugin.  You can 
create a qrc file, call QT4_ADD_RESOURCES in your CMakeLists.txt file and add 
the source file to the SOURCES when you call ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN.

See the ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/Reader   qrc file as an example.  Instead 
of the pqReader.xml you put your .ui file.  And instead of the 
the /ParaViewResources prefix, you make your own prefix.
Then you can reference the ui file as ":/MyPluginPrefix/My.ui" in your plugin 
code.

Amy,
Thats exactly what I want but its not working. I have tried the "Clean 
to Grid" filter and the "Extract Surface" filter with the "Warp 
(scalar)" filter with no luck. I thought the header defined the data 
wrong and maybe I could redefine the header to treat the data as DEM 
data. In VTK the following works and I am trying to recreate it in 
Paraview - thanks.

# Create the geometry conneting the grid of location points
# at this point the surface is flat with an x-y grid of numbers
# (scalars) representing elevations
vtkGeometryFilter geom1
  geom1 SetInput [cropped GetOutput]

# Now warp the surface based on the scalar elevation values
# This creates the 3D mesh model of the terrain
vtkWarpScalar surface1
  surface1 SetInput [geom1 GetOutput]
  surface1 SetScaleFactor -.5

# calculate normals to the 3D mesh cells. This helps generate
# a smoother surface alter on
vtkPolyDataNormals mapnormals
  mapnormals SetInput [surface1 GetPolyDataOutput]
  mapnormals FlipNormalsOn

 Hi all,
Quick question: how to run paraview on Mac OSX Leopard using the 64bit 
technology? Do I have to built it against Cocoa? And if it is the fact, 
how to do this?

Thanks for your help

You can't build ParaView in 64 Bit because you have to build against  
Carbon, which is NOT (at least the GUI Part) going to make the  
transition to 64bit technology. Thank Apple for that.

In order to Build it the following would need to happen.

Apple port carbon gui to 64 bit

or

Qt changes to Cocoa for their underlying OS X implementation, then  
you could build paraview against cocoa.

OR you find a new X_windows implementation that is 64 bit on OS X  
(Good luck, they are all based on Carbon) and build ParaView 2.6.x  
against X Windows.

About the only choice you have is to build VTK against Cocoa and try  
your 64 bit problems against that.


Sorry for all the bad news.

In addition to Mike Jackson's response, you can build a 64 bit paraview server 
with cocoa.  Then build the 32 bit paraview client.

To build the server that way, you turn PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI off, then turn 
VTK_USE_CARBON off and VTK_USE_COCOA on.

Hi,

I was testing around with paraview's python and like it a lot :-)
But I stuck, when creating a cut filter with its 'CutFunction'.
Does anyone can give an advice, where I can find the needed format and
options for most of the filters and esp. this filter? Would be nice!

Regards!

Here is the code I used to try and great a cut plane. The problem seems to
be that everytime I try assign the plane as the cutFunction, paraview
crashes on me.

view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
pxm = servermanager.ProxyManager()

sphere = servermanager.sources.SphereSource(registrationGroup='sources',
registrationName='sphere')
dataDisplay = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(sphere, view,
registrationGroup='representations')

plane = servermanager.sources.PlaneSource()
cut = servermanager.filters.Cut(Input=sphere, registrationGroup='sources',
registrationName='cut')
cut.CutFunction = plane #this seems to crash paraview
dataDisplay2 = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(cut, view,
registrationGroup='representations')

Sreejith,

I figured out the problem.  Your data is written inefficiently.  Each
cell points to its own set of points.  Instead, cells should be sharing
points.  Because no cells are sharing points, ParaView thinks that every
face of every cell is an external face.  The first thing that ParaView
does is to extract all the external faces to render them, and this
bloats the memory significantly.  After rendering the memory consumption
is near the 2 GB limit for 32 bit applications, and ParaView is crashing
because it cannot allocate memory.

Change your program to write out data so that cells share points and
everything should work fine.

The problem is that when you first load in the file and the image is first
displayed, the surface is already extracted to display that.  That extra
large surface will stick around in memory afterwards.

In this case, it would be OK to run clean to grid, write out the result (if
you can get that far), and then load in the resolved grid.  If that is
working for you fine, but anything larger will probably fail.  A better
solution is to write out the data with proper connectivity in the first
place.  If possible, use cell data to model the discontinuous nature rather
than point data.

Message-ID: <20071106220614.CEE8259773@mail.bettencourt.info>

i have noticed that there are no longer any binaries for the stable paraview
available for the PPC platform on OSX.  I looked at the 3.2.0 version and
that seems incomplete (i.e., paraview is not in the bin dir like it is on 
the linux builds)  Is osx-ppc broken?

Thanks
Matt

P.S, i am sure this has been asked before, however, i can't find any way 
to search the mail archives.

3.2.1 will have ppc binaries. Probably before the end of this week.

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin access to render window
Message-ID: <473109E1.1020403@mcs.anl.gov>


Hi:

I'm writing a plugin for Paraview3 that wants to get access to pixel 
data from the render window.  I've been looking for some way to get a 
pointer to the render window so I could add an observer with something like

renderWindowPointer->AddObserver("EndEvent",myRenderEventHandler)

I've tried to find a mechanism for getting a pointer to the render 
window (e.g., retrieve a vtkSMRenderModuleProxy from the 
vtkSMProxyManager), but so far have not had any luck.

I'd be grateful for suggestions as to how I should proceed.

Thanks,
Tom Uram

I tried to build ParaView 3.2 under OS X 10.5 and got the following error:

ld: duplicate symbol

Running a "VERBOSE=1" make gives the following link command where if
you look enough you can see that the linker is linking against both
the debug and release versions of the libQtUiTools library.

Paraview 2.6.2 had an option right in the display tab to label the IDs of all points.  I can't seem to find this option in either 3.0.2 or 3.2.0.  Does anyone know if this is still possible?

Thanks,

With ParaView 3.2, you can add point or cell ID labels to selections.
Make a selection and then open the Selection Inspector (View ->
Selection Inspector).  Scroll down to the bottom and use the Display
Style to turn labels on and off.

Message-ID: <DCF45A25-D9A7-417F-A253-5DA0A07ABEFD@gmail.com>

I have some plugins that I am migrating from PV 2.6x to PV 3.2. The  
current sticking point is the following error:

[ 76%] Building CXX object Servers/ServerManager/CMakeFiles/ 
vtkPVServerManager.dir/vtkSMApplication.o

PVDislocation is the name of my Plugin module. Since the file is auto- 
generated I am not sure what might be going wrong? Include path maybe?

Thanks for any help

	intermixed with polydata broken.
Message-ID: <1194458267.24050.24.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

I would like to create a test for bug 0005688
http://www.cmake.org/Bug/view.php?id=5688 and I need some advice about
how to go about it. 

I tried recording a test that:
	used the built-in serial server
		created a wavelet source
		set it to use volume rendering
		adjusted the volume rendering to be more transparent
		created a sphere source with center 6,0,0 and radius 4
		saved a test image
		deleted the sphere and wavelet source
	switched to a local parallel server
		created a wavelet source
		set it to use volume rendering
		adjusted the volume rendering to be more transparent
		created a sphere source with center 6,0,0 and radius 4
		and saved a second test image

The recording went fine and I posted the xml and png files at
	http://crab-lab.zool.ohiou.edu/kevin/mixed_vol_and_surf_test/
but when I play the test file paraview crashes. I played the test again
in paraview run in ddd and got a backtrace.

Message-ID: <BF37484D-5804-49EC-8CC5-DA64C9682B2F@gmail.com>

I got my custom plugins to compile against ParaView 3.2 and all my  
custom readers seem to work but my filters do NOT show up anywhere in  
the Filter menu.

I have server manager XML defined as follows:

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
   <ProxyGroup name="filters">

	   <SourceProxy name="BurgerVector" class="vtkBurgerVectorFilter">
	     <InputProperty
	        name="Input"
	        command="SetInputConnection">
	          <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
	            <Group name="sources"/>
	            <Group name="filters"/>
	          </ProxyGroupDomain>
	          <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
	            <DataType value="vtkUnstructuredGrid"/>
	          </DataTypeDomain>
	     </InputProperty>
	
	     <DoubleVectorProperty

	     </DoubleVectorProperty>
	   </SourceProxy>
	  </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

I tried wading through the wiki but I am no longer sure what applies  
to PV 2 and what applies to PV 3

Any idea what is wrong?

    Linking CXX executable ../../bin/pvbatch
    libvtkhdf5.so: undefined reference to `H5TN_term_interface'

The command "nm libvtkhdf5.so|fgrep term_interface" shows that it is indeed 
missing. Howver, it is present on a 32-bit serial system where I built the same 
version of paraview.

System:
    ParaView 2.6.1
    MPICH2-0.9.8-15
    cmake 2.4.7
    gcc 4.1.1
    CentOS release 5

Thanks for your help; I got the same problem as you. Is there a chance
that your pv-dump could help? I took a look at a cut filter dump, but
it's a bit confusing due to the 'old' style.
As you mentioned earlier,the other approach to batch process data files
would be to load state files using python, but  it seems that I am not
able to just change the data file name in the state file!? In addition
to that I tried to use the 'batch Record Test' option, which should work
with python too, but it seems, that just 'xml' output is working so
far...!? I would say a good python 'dump' tool would be the best
approach :-)

Fabian

It appears to be a cmake bug in version 2.4.?, and it also appears to already 
be fixed in CVS cmake.

So possible workarounds are:
- Set your BUILD_TYPE to Release
- Get a newer cmake (I don't know when it was fixed).
- others ??


If you're curious, this demonstrates the problem 
 === CMakeLists.txt =====
ADD_LIBRARY(A a.c)
ADD_LIBRARY(Ad a.c)

ADD_LIBRARY(B b.c)
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(B debug Ad optimized A)
# if building shared libs, cmake correctly links B with -lAd OR -lA

ADD_EXECUTABLE(C c.c)
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(C B)
# cmake incorrectly set C to link with "-lB -lAd -lA" if build type is Debug
# cmake correctly set C to link with "-lB -lA" if build type is Release

Subject: [Paraview] Selection frustrum problem

Just something I noticed.

Our reader module (for OpenFOAM) installs a malloc 
routine (through __malloc_hook) which initialises 
all memory to NaN. It also sets floating point 
trapping (FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_INVALID | 
FE_OVERFLOW). We use this as a simple way of 
catching uninitialised data.

I've noticed that I get a floating point exception 
when I do a cell (or point) selection i.e. it 
seems to use uninitialised data. If I switch off 
the exception handling it works just fine.

I attach a traceback of the error. Lines 0..2 are 
from our exception trapping routine. Last 
vtk/paraview routine is #3, SetFrustum.

Kind regards,

Mattijs

Subject: [Paraview] symbol lookup error
Message-ID: <1194530738.21688.12.camel@rachel>

Hello!

This is my first time installing Paraview so I don't have much
experience with it. My machine has CentOS 5 and this is what uname -a
says:

Linux <mymachine> 2.6.18-8.1.15.el5 #1 SMP Mon Oct 22 08:32:28 EDT 2007
x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

The version of Paraview I installed is 3.2.0. When I try to run it I got
this error:

/paraview: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib64/libreadline.so.5: undefined
symbol: PC

Does anybody know why this is happening?
Should I send any additional information about my machine/configuration?

Thank you so much,

Ginet

Hello,

I would like to try paraview 3.0.2, but I cannot see any non-highlighted 
text (menus, dialogs, ...), as I use a dark desktop scheme (recent 
Gentoo linux, KDE 3.5) with black background and light-gray text. Is 
there any way of setting the font/backgound colors?

thank you,

I've managed to work around the problem by going into the binary tree and deleting

    bin/libvtkhdf5.so
    Utilities/hdf5/H5Tinit.c

and then entering "make" again. This suggests an error in one of the cmake files.

Subject: [Paraview] 3.2 Plugin loading
Message-ID: <473366BD.5000302@users.sourceforge.net>

What do you all think of adding a minor convenience to the plugin 
loading process?  I know it isn't that hard, but many of my users don't 
remember to use Plugin Manager or PV_PLUGIN_PATH, and don't want to 
bother adding it to their dot-files.  Thus I am forced to wrap all the 
executables with scripts that set it.

What about the following alternative:
Modify pqPluginManager::loadPlugins() to also load plugins from 
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/plugins  (where CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX gets set in 
CMake).

That way (assuming I do a make install) any plugins that I place in the 
plugins directory get loaded.

If you like it, what chance is there of getting it into the 3.2.1 
release?  I'm willing to try it myself and make a patch for you all at 
Kitware.

Thanks,
Sean

Hey Mike,

If your custom plugins are being compiled correctly there should be  
libraries which are generated during the build. Once you are in  
ParaView, go to the menu Tools => Manage Plugins... and you can  
manually load these libraries (server or client side). You can also  
set the PV_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to the directory  
containing the plugin libraries and they'll be loaded on application  
launch.

Sounds good Sean. However, you missed the 3.2.1 release. I finished
making the binaries yesterday :-) If it is small enough patch, we can
put it in 3.2.2.

Hi Ginet,

It sounds like the system we built the binaries on has incompatible
runtime libraries with yours. Which binary did you try? If you tried
the 64 bit one, you may want to try the 32 bit one and vice versa.
Otherwise, I am afraid you will have to build paraview from source. If
you have to do that, there are build instructions here:

Message-ID: <865E110C-06A3-43FD-B340-EE5375C6E06A@cs.duke.edu>

Hey Folks,

I am happy the Xdmf support has been turned back on in recent  
versions of ParaView (3.2 & 3.3).

I was under the impression, though, that it would be Xdmf 2 once it  
was re-activated, but I'm having trouble reading in files which I  
think are in the correct (new) format. Also, when I write (save) to  
Xdmf it looks more like the old format. Am I probably just screwing  
something up, or is the transition not complete yet?

Also, it is my understanding that to animate a time series of Xdmf  
data sets I will have to do something analogous to what is described  
in "Making custom readers work with file series" in the  
Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series Wiki entry. (i.e. I can't use a .pvd  
file to describe time steps for file formats other than the vtk  
native ones)  Is this correct?

Thanks a lot for the help,
-Eric

Hello Eric,

Your code is probably fine. The transition is not yet complete, but we
(Kitware and ARL) are working toward updating VTK and ParaView support for
XDMF as part of the ParaView 3.4 development effort.

This is a summary of the state of  XDMF in ParaView 3.2:
* The writer writes files in the original XDMF format. It has not yet been
rewritten to take advantage of the new features in the new XDMF.
* The reader partially supports the new XDMF format. It is not yet capable
of producing deep tree structures, and instead collapses them to a single
level.
* Temporal support and Parameter support have been temporarily removed from
XDMF and thus ParaView. We plan to add them back, but until then you will
have to shoehorn them in as you have suggested.

cheers,
Dave DeMarle

Kitware and ARL will be improving the XDMF reader and writer in the next
release.

Ahh, of course I missed it.  Also, of course, I just finished getting 
3.2.0 set up and deployed to all the users.  :)

I'll wait for your 3.2.1 announcement, get the source, make the mods 
there and send a patch.  I'll deploy my modified version to the users 
until 3.2.2 comes out.

Thanks again,
Sean

Hey again,

Regarding setting the PV_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to auto- 
load plugins: I just remembered that you are probably using OS X, so  
just in case you weren't aware of them, I thought I'd pass along the  
tricks I learned recently for setting environment variables in OS X  
for "double-clickable" apps.

Here's a link describing how to set environment variables for all  
processes launched by a specific user:
http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html

You can also set the environment on an app-by-app basis by editing  
the Info.plist file in an application package, as referred to at the  
bottom of this page:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/ 
BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/EnvironmentVars.html

For example, in ParaView 3 I can use the Property List Editor to  
modify [...]/paraview.app/Contents/Info.plist, adding the  
LSEnvironment Property List Key to look like:
http://www.duke.edu/~emonson/Image-5972b59f.tiff

or, editing the xml text directly in Info.plist, I would just add  
these lines as a key-value pair:
         <key>LSEnvironment</key>
         <dict>
                 <key>PV_PLUGIN_PATH</key>
                 <string>/Users/emonson/Programming/ParaView_cvs/ 
ParaView3_build/bin</string>
         </dict>

then when I double-click paraview.app my plugins are loaded  
automatically.

Hope this is helpful to someone,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] loading multiple case files (sos)
Message-ID: <473417D9.10602@epfl.ch>

Hi,

I am trying to use an sos file to load case files in parallel but it
doesn't work (Paraview 3.0.1)

The case files loads each a different partition of the mesh and the
corresponding data (which is repeated on common nodes). If I load the
files one after the other I have a correct complete geometry/data.

I would like to load them automatically. For this I would like to write
a file (e.g., an sos file), that takes care of loading all my case files
(in a parallel or a serial paraview session).

I've tries with sos / ensight gold format but paraview freezes all the
time but with one server and one case file (which is quite useless ;-) )

Does somebody have a hint, please?
I join my sos and case files (but not the data files: its a lot of data
and I know they are correct, since hand-loading works).

Thank you very much
best
Simone

Note: the server starts well, I can select the sos file, it shows the
right variables. I select little endian and press apply. After that
paraview freezes.

Subject: [Paraview] Record Test Guidelines?
Message-ID: <1194616624.4621.16.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

Are there any guidelines for the creation of XML tests? 

I would like to create a test for bug 5688. The bug only occurs in
parallel execution and produces an incorrect result.

The test would need to connect to a parallel server and compare the
parallel result to the serial result. Is this even possible with the XML
system?

Looking through the XML tests in
ParaView3/Applications/Client/Testing/XML I do not see that any test
screenshots are recorded nor that any connections are made to servers.

We do use xml files to make the server connections before reading the 
xml file containing the test.  See the xml.in files in the 
Applications/Client/Testing/Cxx/ directory.  Which means the tests 
should be independent of what the server connection will be.

You can record your test with the default builtin connection.
Play it back to make sure it did what you want, then go into 
client/server mode, and play it back again to compare.

Or if you add it to the list of tests in 
Applications/Client/CMakeLists.txt line 254,
ctest -R MyTestName -N will show you the available tests as a result, 
and you should get something like
pqClientMyTestName-Builtin, pqClientMyTestName-ClientServer, etc....

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with animations
Message-ID: <006601c822e1$95bf5730$d206a8c0@oe.com>

When I was using ParaView 2.6, I used to generate cool animations where
several parts of my problems could appear and disappear during the
animation.

In ParaView 3.2, I do not find the option "opacity" in the list of
properties to animate.

Is this feature set in another place? Has it been deleted?

 

Moreover, I often have a crash when exporting an animation in avi file with
ParaView 3.2. It happens just after selecting the dimensions of the
animation (I usually keep the default values).

 

 

 

One more question: when does the ParaView Guide 3.2 will be ready?

 

Thank you

Thanks, Berk. The 32-bit binary seems to work.

Hello Xiaojian,

There is no easy way to do that within the UI right now. I have added this
as a feature request (bug #6033 specifically) to the bug tracker.

Hello again,

In the meantime a workaround is to run the extract selection filter, and
then save the data as a .vtk file with ascii formatting. The list of cells
will be contained in an array called vtkOriginalCellIds, and points will be
in vtkOriginalPointIds.

hth,

I submitted a feature request for this.

  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=6040

I have no idea how long it would take to implement something like this.
There are several new features in ParaView 3 that complicate animating
display parameters like opacity.

Hi,

I am sorry for the late response to this. I've commented out the off 
screen rendering in the file you suggested,

#if !defined(__APPLE__)
//  this->GetRenderWindow()->SetOffScreenRendering(1);
#endif

and

#if !defined(__APPLE__)
//  this->GetRenderWindow()->SetOffScreenRendering(0);
#endif

recompiled and installed. However, I still have a similar problem. When 
I save an animation, the image doesn't update in the animation after 15 
frames or so.

Do you have any other suggestions?

Thanks,
Berend.

Subject: [Paraview] Shortcuts to creating batch files in 3.*?
Message-ID: <164F0202-245A-4CD4-BDF0-8969C136CCEC@northwestern.edu>

Hi all,

In the 2.x series of paraview, I recall there was an option like  
'save batch script' , which was an easy way to get a start on  
creating a batch script (say do it for 1 outputfile, then modify the  
text file with a loop to do many of the same operation)

It appears there is no such option now that the scripting has been  
switched to python, or am I just missing how to do it? Is there some  
way to get this from the 'save state' option (which seems to be xml,  
not python)?

If there isn't, is there any free documentation available on how to  
set them up? In my brief search, I couldn't seem to find even an  
example file.

Thanks,

Dave

I've created a wiki page that should answer your questions:

Hi Dave,

There is a tool (a python script) going around that converts state xml
files to python scripts. Someone will probably respond with a copy. It
should be probably put on the paraview wiki. There is documentation
for the python interface available on the wiki:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/Servermanager2.pdf

Hi All,

How do I apply the Quadric Clustering filter to a 3D Unstructured Grid? (it
is greyed out in the menu) Or is there another way to coarsen the mesh?
I've used it with great success on 2D cutplanes.

A bit of coding and compiling is not a problem for me.

Thank you.

Hi,

the way I do it is to extract first the surface of the unstructured grid 
(vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter), then it is possible to use quadric clustering.

Message-ID: <47397CB3.9040407@kth.se>

Hi,

someone have an idea how to extract the coordinate extrema of a dataset 
in PV? Suppose you extract with the threshold filter a certain volume 
cell region (unstructured), how can one then plot (e.g. over time) the 
minimum x-coordinate of the threshold?

The only hit on this in the PV mailing list is from the end of 2006, 
when Berk answered to a feature request for the calculator:

If someone has an idea on how to access this data (min/max), please tell 
me/us.

Maybe it is possible by using the python interface (PV3; programmable 
filter)? Any ideas?


Regards, Simone

Hi Simone,

Thank you for your answer.

I am not sure I understand your suggestion. When I apply the 'Extract
Surface' filter only my (3D) surfaces remain and the Quadric
Clustering filter becomes available.

But I need the volume cells, not the surfaces. Am I doing something wrong?

regards,
Sylvester

Hi,

OK, sorry I misread your post ... I obviously thought that you want to 
apply quadric clustering on a boundary grid.
I hope somebody else can help you out on how to do it for a volume 
dataset, as I also didn't manage so far with it!

I have actually completed the adapter and the linking inside pqNamedWidgets
for the qDateEdit Widget. It returns a String of the Date using the ISO date
format (day-month-year).

Is there any intreset on the paraview side for this being added? If so would
I just file a bug report for 3.3?

And once again thanks for the wiki page, and the prompt replys.

I see no Tecplot reader or writer in VTK.  Without the basic implementation,
ParaView cannot write in this format.

I have cc?ed the paraview mailing list to see if anyone else out there knows
of a tecplot writer that was never contributed back to VTK or ParaView.

I have a TecPlot Reader that I've integrated into our visualization tool
ezViz (http://daac.hpc.mil/ezviz) .  It reads TecPlot Binary files and
creates vtkStructuredGrids, that are all appended into a large Unstructured
Grid (I'm working with an AMR multizone mesh).

Quadric Clustering only applies to Polygonal datasets.  Volumetric Datasets
cannot be decimated via the Quadric Clustering algorithm.  Using the Extract
Surface simply extracts a polygonal outer surface from your volume which is
why you're then able to use it.

Message-ID: <20071114033634.15286.qmail@f5mail12.rediffmail.com>

I am trying to write a Tecplot file converter (in python) which converts a Tecplot ASCII file into a vtk-xml file. It involves significant work and it will take some time before a first version could be made available. Once this converter is robust enough, I will try to write vtkTecplotReader and vtkTecplotWriter classes. For time being you can use Visit which supports Tecplot file formats. Visit is based on VTK, unfortunately they didn't back ported many of Visit's new features to VTK. To find more about Visit go to :

That code was written for the old python interface, I am pretty sure that if
you want that to run in 3.2 you will have to update the code.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with updating color map values
Message-ID: <824681.36129.qm@web58602.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Dear All,

I have the following problem : I have a bunch of time series data files, say
file-001.vtu,...file-010.vtu, and  I wan to make a movie using these files.
While creating the movie I don't want to fix the color map values in Scalar bar.
There is a "lock and unlock" button in "Edit color map values". When  this 
button toggled to unlock I should expect that during the each frame the color map
values should update automatically to the current frame maximum and minimum
values.  But I could not see the change of color map values during the creation 
of movie. Is it possible to do this using paraview-2.6.2 version?

Can anybody help me how to do this?

thank you in advance.

Nagaiah





 using the Paraview 2.6.2 verson.

Hi!

We have developed a vtkUnstructuredGridQuadricDecimation filter that  
simplifies 3-D unstructured grids. It implements a non-streamable  
version of the algorithm described in "Streaming Simplification for  
Tetrahedral Meshes Grids", H. Vo, S. Callahan, P. Lindstrom, V.  
Pascucci, and C. Silva, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and  
Computer Graphics, 13(1):145-155, 2007.

We would be happy to contribute this code to VTK, if people find it  
useful. We have been using it "in house" at Utah for 2 years now, and  
it has been quite stable.

In the meantime, I can simply send a copy to whoever wants it. Please  
let me know.

Claudio.

When CMake's ADD_TEST() is called to add the tests depending on server 
connections, it invokes the pvTestDriver, which in turn starts up the 
server(s), then starts up the client.  The client runs those xml files to 
make the connection to the server(s).  You may have seen pvTestDirver when 
you ran ctest with the -V option.

There are currently a couple python based tests that do this.
See line 238 in ParaView3/Applications/Client/CMakeLists.txt
The downside is the python script has the names of the plugins and loads them 
manually in the test.  That might be fine to test the ability to load them 
manually.

But in general, I think a better approach would be to make a test driver that 
set the PV_PLUGIN_PATH variable.  There might be a way to call ctest and have 
it do that for us.

Is this your own build?  Or from the download site?
If its your own build can you turn VTK_USE_RPATH on and see if the error goes 
away?  Or check things out with ldd.  Or even check that libpqWidgets.so 
linked with libQtGui.so.

Built locally; I'll try that.

Already did that. ldd reveals no missing libraries, and libpqWidgets.so 
is indeed linked with libQtGui.so.

 Re: [Paraview] Re: Tecplot writer (was: parallel paraview)

I have a TecPlot Reader that I've integrated into our visualization tool ezViz (http://daac.hpc.mil/ezviz) .  It reads TecPlot Binary files and creates vtkStructuredGrids, that are all appended into a large Unstructured Grid (I'm working with an AMR multizone mesh). 


On Nov 13, 2007 1:07 PM, kmorel <kmorel@sandia.gov> wrote:

I see no Tecplot reader or writer in VTK.  Without the basic implementation, ParaView cannot write in this format.

I have cc'ed the paraview mailing list to see if anyone else out there knows of a tecplot writer that was never contributed back to VTK or ParaView.

Dear Ken,



I tried reverserse connnection but pvserver at local node cannot locate client
machine. I also talked with system admin and it seems that neither incomming
nor outgoing connections are possible at the local nodes. I wonder whether you
have any other suggestion. May be use of frontal machine.



Best wishes,

You can use the reverse connection (-rc) option on both pvserver and pvclient
to

tell ParaView to connect from server to client. In this case you will also need
to

add the --client-host option to pvserver to tell where to connect to.

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable Filter: UpdateProgress and input for
	Threshold
Message-ID: <78c9e64422348e4b6f4538fa8496e28d@free.fr>

Hi all,

I wrote the following programmable filter in Paraview 3.2:

from math import sqrt
pdi = self.GetInput()
pdo = self.GetOutput()
newData = paraview.vtkDoubleArray()
newData.SetName("Max length edge")
numCells = pdi.GetNumberOfCells()
self.SetProgressText("Max length edge")

for i in range(0, numCells):
       cell = pdi.GetCell(i)
       value = max([ cell.GetEdge(i).GetLength2() for i in [0, 1, 2]])
       newData.InsertNextValue(sqrt(value))
       self.UpdateProgress(i/numCells)

pdo.GetCellData().AddArray(newData)

So I have 2 problems and questions:

- SetProgressText and UpdateProgress calls seems to be not taken into account (i.e. the progress bar stay grey). Is it because it's not yet supported or because my script is wrong ?
- If I use this script in a Programmable filter, I can use its output as input for Threshold or Histogram filters. If I create a Custom Filter from this Programmable filter, it CANNOT be used as input for Threshold or Histogram. Why ?

Regards,

Jerome

I also miss it.
By the way, do you think it will be possible to change the number of labels
of the cube axes? It used to be only 3 in PV2.6.

In the Good Old Days loading

paraview*font: -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-18-*-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1

with xrdb (on a Linux/X11 system) changed the font used for the GUI. After a 
little trial and error I haven't yet found the corresponding method for 3.2b. 
The default font is almost too small for me to read.

Thanks, Alexander. On other systems I have successfully built 3.2beta using Qt 
4.2.2. When no Qt at all is installed cmake says it needs 4.2.2 or higher. What 
causes you to think that 4.2.3 is required?

Message-ID: <473CAEEA.1020205@psc.edu>

I have both Qt 4.2.2 and Qt 4.3.2 in /usr/local and set QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE to 
the qmake in 4.2.2. But after it all compiled weird things happened such as the 
problem posted as "_ZN11QHeaderView5resetEv Where Are You?".

In CMakeCache.txt I found that QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE is indeed the value I set 
but all the other Qt values were set to items in 4.3.2. That doesn't seem right 
-- cmake should use the path I gave it.

I'm going to have to temporary hide Qt 4.3.2 (which will temporarily break 
other applications) and rebuild the whole thing.

Can you set the QTDIR environment variable? If you can (and not mess  
up other apps) then set it to where your Qt 4.2.2 installation is.

<opinion> I also have to have BOTH Qt 4.2.3 AND 4.3.2 on my system.  
At which point I sandboxed BOTH installations into /Users/Shared/ 
Toolkits/Qt432 and /Users/Shared/Toolkits/Qt423. I then export  
QTDIR='/Users/Shared/Toolkits/Qt423' before running a fresh cmake on  
the project. Just my 2 cents</opinion>

Hi Kent,

You need to use qtconfig to change the GUI settings. I don't think this 
executable is included in the binary distribution. If you built Qt 
yourself, you'll have executable along with other Qt binaries.

Do you have a ~/.config/Trolltech.conf file?
It might be overriding your desktop settings for Qt applications.

If you don't do anything with qtconfig, it should use your desktop settings 
(or settings from xrdb).
Try deleting your ~/.config/Trolltech.conf file if it exists (qtconfig creates 
that).

You can also try giving paraview the font at startup.
paraview -font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-18-*-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1

Thanks! That didn't make a difference. I'm using paraview*font. Does 3.2 use 
another resource name?

That works perfect.

No I do not have ~/.config/Trolltech.conf.

Note that I have turned on the KDE option 'apply colors to non-KDE
applications', as I would like to have a uniform look of applications.
Without this option, the standard color theme of paraview is ok, but
then the other non-KDE apps I use are also affected.

thanks,

I am not 100% sure but I am guessing this is a limitation of custom
filters. I would consider custom filters in development stage. We have
several significant improvement to make before they are fully
functional. I hope to have it done by 3.4 but it may be delayed until
3.6.

Message-ID: <22396194.1561195217515963.OPEN-XCHANGE.WebMail.tomcat@sala.cscs.ch>

Dear list

we are having a problem with a filter definition, using both the PLUGIN
method or the EXTERNAL_MODULE method in the release version of PV3.2.1.
The same code used to work fine under a 3.1 CVS checkout.

The definition (shortened here) includes the following code, and the
problem is that the FileListDomain causes the entire StringVector to
disappear. The filter's GUI shows no vector input? at all. If we comment
out the single line ??? <FileListDomain name="files"/>, then the
filter's GUI shows an input vector, and our filter executes just fine.

What's the hitch?

<ProxyGroup name="filters">
????<SourceProxy name="name" class="vtkname">
?????<InputProperty
????????...stuff deleted
?????</InputProperty>
???<StringVectorProperty
????????????name="FileName"
????????????number_of_elements="1">
???<FileListDomain name="files"/>
?????</StringVectorProperty>

What style were you using with your theme(s)?
There were some issues with using the CleanLooks style and I made some 
changes to the code yesterday that might fix your problem.
I've played with kde themes and they apply just fine to my paraview.

Again, thank you for all your help.

It looks like I've gone and polluted the dashboard with my failed test:
http://paraview.org/ParaView3/Testing/Sites/gargon.hooperlab/Linux-gcc-4.1.2-x86_64/20071116-0100-Nightly/Results/__Applications_Client_pqClientMixedSurfaceAndStructuredVolumeRendering-ClientServer.html

I'll add -C to my CVS update options, but in the mean time there are the
correct and incorrect images.

Resolved: cmake was using the given version of Qt (4.2.2) for "qmake" but then 
found another version on our system (4.3.2) for all the other pieces of Qt.

Before I realized the two problems were related I report cmake's unwise 
decision as "CMake Doesn't Use Correct Qt Building 3.2b".

To clear all references to 4.3.2 I erased the entire binary tree. I temporarily 
renamed the 4.3.2 directory so cmake couldn't find it; rebuilt; and everything 
worked fine.

Thanks to everyone for their advice!

Message-ID: <473DD65E.4090604@psc.edu>

As the cursor is sliding across the menubar items ("File", "Edit", ...) each 
item's menu pops up as expected. However, when the cursor gets to "Filters", 
and it is disabled, the GUI becomes temporarily hung -- no more menus popup as 
the cursor is slid to other items. Releasing the mouse button resets things.

You're relying on a temporary behavior duing the 3.1 development.
Neither 3.0 or 3.2 does what you want (default behavior is to hide the first 
property with FileListDomain).
I've add this: http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=6060

For now, you can create a .ui file of what you want it to look like (including 
the filename property) and put that in your plugin.
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_an_object_panel

Or some other solution you might like better.

I am not 100% sure but I am guessing this is a limitation of custom
filters. I would consider custom filters in development stage. We have
several significant improvement to make before they are fully
functional. I hope to have it done by 3.4 but it may be delayed until
3.6.

Hi -

I see Paraview groups sequential VTK files e.g.:
	segment_1.vtk
	segment_2.vtk
	segment_3.vtk
	segment_4.vtk
	...

I was wondering if there's a way of getting VTK to such files at once. I 
don't mind resorting to a script, but I appreciate help writing such a 
script.

Many thanks,

- Olumide

Olumide--

If you are using XML-formatted versions of VTK-files, ParaView will read 
a single *.pvd file that "lists" the file-set. File names don't matter 
when you are using the *.pvd meta-file.

See attached example of a *.pvd file.

What type of data are you loading? Slices of an image, polygonal data
that need to be appended together...? How many files are there in a
group?

Subject: [Paraview] How to fly through animation PV 3
Message-ID: <WorldClient-F200711191138.AA38420131@wbmpl.com.au>

Hi everyone,

How would you go about setting up a fly through animation in Paraview 3? 
I'm using 3.2.  Animating a time series is fairly easy/automated. I can
manually build frames of a view using the Camera object in the GUI, and
change say the camera azimuth at each step, although when the frame is
saved the camera settings flick back to the original view before the frame
change, which is a little inconvenient.  Maybe a scripted solution?  But I
wouldn't know where to start...

Thanks Sam. I've just created my first PVD file, here's a snip of it:

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
   <Collection>
     <DataSet timestep="0" group="" part="0" file="Trace_Path_1.vtk" />
     <DataSet timestep="0" group="" part="0" file="Trace_Path_2.vtk" />
     <DataSet timestep="0" group="" part="0" file="Trace_Path_3.vtk" />
   </Collection>
</VTKFile>


Unfortunately, Paraview crashes whenever I load this file. QT throws an 
exception that Paraview does not catch.

Is there anything wrong with my PVD file? Also, do you know where I can 
find a PVD file format description online?

Thanks,

- Olumide

Hello,
I think you cannot use PVD file for VTK legacy file format. PVD file
can be used with XML format files for instance .vti, .vts, .vtu etc. I
am not sure what actually you want to do. If you are trying to open
your files Trace_Path_1.vtk, Trace_Path_2.vtk and Trace_Path_3.vtk for
some sort of animation, then simple way is explained here
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series. However, if
you want to use PVD file then I think series files should be in XML
format. XML format files are certainly much more elegant.

Good luck,

Message-ID: <7f8801500711190247pe069dd1r474d1d8af748a218@mail.gmail.com>

Dear paraview user and developers!

I'd like to compile the 3.2 version of paraview with the support for
parallel processing using openmpi libraries:

Since my distro (debian testing) has a newer version of qt4 libraries, I
have compiled the 4.2 version of Qt, installing them in the default path
/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.3.

Configuring paraview with ccmake, I set:

QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE = /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.3/bin/qmake (instead of
/usr/bin/qmake-qt4)

I have modified also:

PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON = ON
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI = ON

The path for mpi library (openmpi) is:
MPI_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libmpi.so
MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY= NOTHING

After running the configuration command, I obtain the following error during
make compilation:

Kent,

On what platform are you running?  I just tried this on both Mac and

Olumide--

1) At any given time step, part="nnn" needs to count/id the components 
for the model. Each part (for example, Trace_Path_1.vtk) must be a 
complete, displayable graphics object.

2) The the files referenced must be written in VTK's XML-format: 
http://www.vtk.org/documents.php

3) I am not aware that group="" is a word that the parser knows. It 
skips unknown words.

That's an X windows routine. Check the cmake variables that point to the X 
windows and the OpenGL libraries. I built ParaView 3.2 using MPICH on a CentOS 
system last week with no problems.

  Finally we have paraview working in parallel in our cluster. The images

FYI: When making some changes to the PVD reader in 2.6.1 I became quite 
familiar with this part of the code. I never did find anything that used the 
"part" attribute. Of course, its a good idea to set this attribute anyway so 
that it is easier to read the pvd file. And this attribute might be used in the 
future.

ParaView never automatically rescales the color map when the time step
changes.  This is by design as an animation with the color map being
rescaled would lead to extremely misleading visualizations.

Dear All,

I have the following problem : I have a bunch of time series data files,
say
file-001.vtu,...file-010.vtu, and  I wan to make a movie using these
files.
While creating the movie I don't want to fix the color map values in
Scalar bar.
There is a "lock and unlock" button in "Edit color map values". When
this 
button toggled to unlock I should expect that during the each frame the
color map
values should update automatically to the current frame maximum and
minimum
values.  But I could not see the change of color map values during the
creation 
of movie. Is it possible to do this using paraview-2.6.2 version?

Can anybody help me how to do this?

thank you in advance.

This was just a first test (that run blew off in the end). I'll rather 
wait a little bit more and have better images (content). I'll get back to 
you later, ok?

Dear Kenneth,
Thank you very much for your response. For certain simulations this feature is 
more useful. At present I am using some other visualization package, which 
supports  rescaling the color map values when time step changes
and it looks better for my simulation results. Just I would like to know
whether paraview  developers had some idea to include this option in future
releases.

I build ParaView nightly with the same non system Qt, and OpenMPI. I set
a few variables in my ~/.bash_profile that help CMake find QT:

	QT423=/opt/qt-4.2.3
	PATH=$QT423/bin:$PATH
	export PATH
	CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=$QT423/lib:$CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
	export CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
	CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=$QT423/include:$CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
	export CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
	
I also set the CMake initial path with:
	CMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING=-I/usr/include/openmpi/openmpi/
	CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-I/usr/include/openmpi/openmpi/
	PARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON

Probably the error depends on the presence of two version of Qt4 library:
the debian version (4.3) and a compiled version (4.2). It is possible to
force paraview to use the 4.3 version of the Qt library?

I see it on X11 (haven't tried Windows .. and on Mac the native menu bar 
is used so that's different).
I've sent a report off to Trolltech.
I see more weird behavior as a result of moving with the mouse pressed 
through a disabled menu, than you reported.

Dear list

I cannot manage to change the XY plot axis range to actually plot my
graph between -90 and +90.  We do drawing of variables against latitude
in degrees, thus between -90 and +90.

 Specifying the axis range of the Bottom axis only shifts the viewport
but not the graph itself. I am generating a one-dimensional Rectilinear
grid with X coordinates between -90 and +90.

Seems the generated default is to draw between 0 and the maximum "Point
ID", but I have found no way to shift the whole plot between -90 and +90.

Any hint would be appreciated.

Jean

I think the behavior you describe as happening is the intended behavior
(if I understand your email correctly).  The X axis reflects the value
of some variable.  Thus, when you change the X axis, you are either
zooming in or out.  Simply changing the numbers in the axis would be
amazingly misleading.

It sounds like the X axis is listing indices (which are never very
interesting) instead of latitude.  Assuming latitude is an array in your
data, you can use the latitude array on the X axis by selecting it in
the Display panel.  If you don't have a latitude array, you may be able
to synthesize one using point coordinates in the array calculator.

Nagaiah,

 

There are no plans to change the behavior.  This issue has been the
source of many disagreements amongst the ParaView developers.  However,
as convenient as it is to have the color map rescale when the time
changes (as well as easy to implement), ultimately it creates animations
that misrepresent how the data changes over time.

 

Could you describe your use case in more detail?  What exactly do you
mean by "looks better"?  Does the scalar range shift or grow over time?
Both cases will make all the colors map to near the same color for some
or all time steps.  However, when you run the animation in a sequence,
you will see the overall color shift in a way that is highly indicative
of how the scalar changes over time.  If you resize the scale at every
time step, you will surely get more detail per time step, but you will
totally lose the sense of how the variable changes over time (which is
the point of playing over time).  Furthermore, the result could be
highly misleading.  The constantly rescaled colors would show shifts of
the scalar over time that simply do not exist.  They are an artifact of
the rescaling.  Do you have some use case in which these concerns do not
apply?

 

-Ken

Dear Kenneth,
Thank you very much for your response. For certain simulations this
feature is 
more useful. At present I am using some other visualization package,
which 
supports  rescaling the color map values when time step changes
and it looks better for my simulation results. Just I would like to know
whether paraview  developers had some idea to include this option in

Dear All,

I have the following problem : I have a bunch of time series data files,
say
file-001.vtu,...file-010.vtu, and  I wan to make a movie using these
files.
While creating the movie I don't want to fix the color map values in
Scalar bar.
There is a "lock and unlock" button in "Edit color map values". When
this 
button toggled to unlock I should expect that during the each frame the
color map
values should update automatically to the current frame maximum and
minimum
values.  But I could not see the change of color map values during the
creation 
of movie. Is it possible to do this using paraview-2.6.2 version?

Can anybody help me how to do this?

thank you in advance.

Nagaiah





 using the Paraview 2.6.2 verson.

I think the answer is yes, the coordinates are ignored in the XY-plot
are ignored, but I don't know the details.  Hence, I am forwarding this
to the ParaView mailing list.

I had mean to reply to all, but my fingers slipped.

Actually, it seems like the plot Y=f(X) uses the chord length as the X
axis. If true, it means I cannot have negative values along the X? That
would be too bad.

You can change the X axis array to anything you want.  Negative values
are OK.

Yes indeed.

I can see that, but it does not shift my plot to the left. The whole
left-side from zero is an empty plot. I wanted a plot starting at -90
and ending at +90 on the bottom axis.

"XVisualInfo" is not part of Qt so you'll need to consider my earlier suggestion.

cmake refuses to use Qt 4.3 when building PV 3.2 beta. I suggest you first 
check which version is needed by your version of PV.

You can set the environment variable QTDIR to the desired Qt directory but this 
must be done before running cmake the first time in the build area.

This is probably one of those situations where if we were sitting
together at the same terminal we would have this resolved in a few
minutes, but something vital is getting lost over email.  Negative
values in the X axis work fine.  I just did it.

Have you selected a vector for the X axis?  Are you plotting the
"Magnitude" for the component?  If so, then the magnitude is always
positive (by definition) and there is your problem.  Try selecting the
X, Y, or Z component instead.

Can you possibly send an example of your data?  That might make things
go quicker.

Are the x and y values in one array? If so, under the "X Axis Data"  
heading select the array and set the component to "x". Then, under the  
"Line Series" heading, check the array and set the component to "y".  
The component may be hard to see. So, you'll have to scroll the view  
to the right.

Dear Kenneth,

Yes, I agree with your comments. In my simulation results, I need to check the
validation of my numerical results. In this case, we (I am a mathematician and
my colleagues from Engineering dept) keen on to see the data range for each 
time step.  They (engineers) want to see a movie with updating
the scalar bar values according to the each file. That is the main reason I 
am very interested to see this option in PARAVIEW. The word
"looks better" mentioned in my previous mail regarding checking my
numerical results using the other visualization package(their internal package). That means, in my numerical simulations the acting source
term has on and off behavior. When source activate, the data range
in the numerical results is very large and when it is off the data range is small. In 
this particular period we are particularly interested  to see the behavior 
of solution as well as the data range during the animation.

  There are no plans to change the behavior.  This issue has been the source of many disagreements amongst the ParaView developers.  However, as convenient as it is to have the color map rescale when the time changes (as well as easy to implement), ultimately it creates animations that misrepresent how the data changes over time.
   
  Could you describe your use case in more detail?  What exactly do you mean by ?looks better??  Does the scalar range shift or grow over time?  Both cases will make all the colors map to near the same color for some or all time steps.  However, when you run the animation in a sequence, you will see the overall color shift in a way that is highly indicative of how the scalar changes over time.  If you resize the scale at every time step, you will surely get more detail per time step, but you will totally lose the sense of how the variable changes over time (which is the point of playing over time).  Furthermore, the result could be highly misleading.  The constantly rescaled colors would show shifts of the scalar over time that simply do not exist.  They are an artifact of the rescaling.  Do you have some use case in which these concerns do not apply?

  Dear Kenneth,
 Thank you very much for your response. For certain simulations this feature is 
 more useful. At present I am using some other visualization package, which 
 supports  rescaling the color map values when time step changes
 and it looks better for my simulation results. Just I would like to know
 whether paraview  developers had some idea to include this option in future
 releases.

Subject: [Paraview] Building 3.2.1 on AIX
Message-ID: <4741C4AC.3040604@users.sourceforge.net>

Has anyone had luck with building 3.2.1 (or any 3.x for that matter) on 
AIX?  It is giving me fits.  I'm using the latest cmake (2.4.7); Qt 
works fine, and I've tried both 32 and 64-bit builds, with and without 
Python and MPI and even completely turning off the client build.  I 
pretty much get the same results.  I have some other things I can try, 
but I'm running out of ideas.

Perhaps someone knows of a compiler or linker switch that is required 
for building on AIX?

The following is the error that I get:

* setenv OBJECT_MODE=64
* setenv CC=xlc
* setenv CXX=xlC
* Add "-D_LARGE_FILES" to the CFLAGS options

but in the inevitable situation that you want some plot functionality that 
paraview does not support, what linux based opensource application can handle 
any of the paraview output formats for XY plots?

Thanks Kevin!

I've successfully compiled paraview with openmpi support, using your
advices.
The only difference with respect to your indications is the different
include path of openmpi  /usr/include/openmpi/ompi instead of
/usr/include/openmpi/openmpi, when I set the Cmake initial path.

CMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING=-I/usr/include/openmpi/ompi/
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-I/usr/include/openmpi/ompi/

Finally got it. Something clicked. Thanks to both Ken and Mark.

I had a good look at vtkPolyLineToRectilinearGridFilter and made the
changes necessary in my filter.

Works great. I can now de-install gnuplot, right?

I did the first three.  I haven't tried -D_LARGE_FILES, but I suspect 
that isn't the problem.  I almost looks like some sort of odd 
template/name mangling/linking issue.

Also, I've compiled VTK before without (too much) trouble.  This seems 
to be a problem specific to ParaView.

But, like I said, I'm running out of ideas.  I will try that define 
option and see what happens...

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

Do you get the same error if you run vtkSMExtractDocumentation on the
command line? Also, can you look for that symbol in libvtkPVFilters.so
by using nm and grep?

Message-ID: <45d654b0711191043w5bcfbf9em27001063339ddf05@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

Kitware, Sandia National Laboratories, CSimSoft and Los Alamos Laboratory
are proud to announce the release of ParaView 3.2.1 (stable). You can
download it from
http://paraview.org/HTML/Download.html.

This release includes the following enhancements/fixes:

* New animation view for viewing, creating, modifying animations. This
is improved version of the ParaView 2.6 animation tracks. We have made
it more intuitive and easier to use.
* The "Element Inspector" has been replaced by brand new "Spreadsheet"
view which makes it possible to view the raw data produced by any
source/filter.
* Filters with multiple outputs and inputs are now supported. This
opened doors for several new filter such as glyph with custom source,
stream tracer with custom point source etc.
* There are several improvements to charts including support for vector
data in line charts (magnitude or component), support for labels, titles
and legends, custom chart axes end points.
* Selection support has undergone a major overhaul. It is now possible
to select cells (or points) on surface of geometry or within a view
frustum by simply dragging on the 3D view. The properties of the
selection can be inspected/changed using the brand new "Selection
Inspector" accessible through the "View" menu. "Extract Selection"
filter can be used to extract the selected cells or points. Labels can
be used to label the selected cells or points.
* Support for eXtensible Data model and Format (XDMF) files is back and
improved to support composite datasets, quadratic elements, mixed
topologies. It is now possible to change domain and grid selections as well.
* We are working on making ParaView totally at ease with composite data
sets. As a part of the process histogram (and soon probe) filters now
work with composite datasets. The python client can fetch composite
datasets as well as perform operations such as min/max/sum on these dataset.
* A new python module is introduced which makes dealing with proxies
convenient. A separate document is available describing these python
enhancements.
* This version has many GUI usability improvements including but
definitely not limited to:
  - view based and application settings.
  - using mouse clicks for picking center of rotation, point widget
location.
* We are constantly trying to make the documentation better. The online
help has been extended to include the new functionality added since 3.0.

We would like to acknowledge Sandia Labs and Los Alamos Lab for their
continuing support and funding.

Enjoy.

I did try that, but nm seems to list the non-mangled names so I wasn't 
able to tell if it was correct or not.

Anyway, I think I have it.  I did 3 things at once:
1. Added -D_LARGE_FILES to C/CXXFLAGS
2. Removed -DNDEBUG from C/CXXFLAGS
3. Added CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE with the same optimization 
options as the other *_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE's.

I know that's bad diagnostic procedure, but it takes _so_ long to build, 
  and I got impatient.  I'll redo the builds with each one at a time to 
see which one fixed it.

Incidentally, I had to change some other things to get this far on AIX, 
including minor changes to ParaViewCommon.cmake.  If you like, once I 
have everything working, I'll send a detailed list of everything I had 
to do.

Thanks,
Sean

Kent--

Thanks for reading and commenting on my "advice."  I now use EnSight 
binary output to be read by ParaView -- lots of pluses for me.

With regard to *.pvd files and the part="nnn" token, the name="abc" 
token is as yet undocumented, but David King did a nice job of hooking 
it up. To wit, the face sheet for Extract Parts (in version 2.4.4 now 
deprecated?) used to use the part numbers from the part="nnn" token, at 
least I thought so. When one has more than two parts (possible 10's of 
parts), staring at a list on numbers from 1 to 38 on the face sheet and 
trying to decide which ones you wanted to extract for "preferential" 
display processing required a crib sheet. The name="abc" token gave user 
names to each part in place of part numbers -- a much better solution.

I see now for a *.pvd file --

1) Version 2.4.4: Extract Parts filter: name="abc" replaces n's; nice touch.

2) Version 2.6.1: Extract Parts filter: extinct, no more, ...

3) Version 3.2.0: Extract Datasets filter: regresses to integers, that 
is, ignores part="n" and name="abc", but appears to add sub-blocks to 
each Group -- no clues on how to specify multiple blocks constituting a 
Group however.

4) Version 3.2.0: Extract Group filter: lists itself as ExtractLevel and 
ignores part="n" and name="abc", only operates on a range n-m.

I am not complaining, I love and count on ParaView.  Large, 
multi-material meshes are my world and the ability to look at a sub-set 
of objects for which I once used the VTK's XML-formats with parts and 
now use the EnSight part-construct are one of my favorite ParaView 
sub-setting abilities.

We are talking about final polishing issues, and it is too soon for 
Version 3.n.m to be subjected to these kinds of requests.

 From watching the mailing lists, for some reason individuals new to 
ParaView seem to want to start with the early VTK file-formats for their 
data (if not csv-formats?).  A good connection between the possible data 
tokens in a *.pvd file and the filter face sheets could, in my view, 
provide a good experience for new users. They can then move to the 
"stronger" ExodusII and EnSight readers/formats (and possibly other 
strong readers of which I am not aware).

Once again, thanks for commenting. I don't mind going back and 
reviewing/refreshing my knowledge base.

--Sam


Only being a skilled in Fortran-90/95 coder, studying filters in 
ParaView does not for me yield a lot of insight.

It looks like the link to the OS X PPC Unix-style tarball is pointing  
to the 3.2.0 version still, but the 3.2.1 version is indeed available  
and downloadable (I changed the link manually in my browser to check).

A good way to get access to all files correctly is listing the directory

Subject: [Paraview] server xml for drop down string list?
Message-ID: <4742E7C3.1090302@cscs.ch>

If you have scalar names supplied using a construct using something like 
the PointArrayStatus which appears in many readers and allows the user 
to select which scalars to load, is there a way of producing a simple 
drop down list (combo box selection) using just the server xml. I want 
to let the user select one scalar array for processing, but can't find a 
simple string selection xml combination that works.

thanks

JB

I assume you have something like this:

<....  repeat_command="1" number_of_elements="0" ... >

patterened after the other PointArrayStatus properties.

Have you tried replacing that with this?

<....  number_of_elements="1" ... >

Hi,

The patch to load nfaced elements with the ensight reader has not been 
integrated in the VTK distribution comming with ParaView3.2.1. 
It is in the cvs version, is it possible to integrate it in a comming 
release?

Thanks

I am going through all the tutorials on
http://visualization.hpc.mil/paraview and updating our tutorials for version
3.2.1.  I have come across the following bug:

When creating a Line Source in ParaView 3.2.1 (Sources-->Line) and choosing
either the X Axis, Y Axis, or Z Axis buttons, a point is effectively created
instead of a line.  The "line" goes from -3.47e-266 to 3.47e-266 for the X
Axis button.  Similar results occur for the Y and Z buttons.  The problem is
that e-266 is effectively zero.

Hello,

With several trials and errors I could not animate the isosurfaces in
Paraview. I could generate number of isosurfaces with certain range,
but may be I didn't know the precise way of animating them. I would be

Many thanks,

Message-ID: <47447B04.5@psc.edu>

Sorry if this was already answered. In 2.6.1 we read a pvd file referencing 
many vtu files then used "append datasets" and "clean to grid" to combine the 
parts into one object. The updates were faster and "stream tracer" worked.

But in 3.2.1 "append datasets" is disabled after reading the pvd file. Is this 
a bug? Is there another way?

Using Fedora Core 5.

This is not a bug. It is a change in direction. We are moving towards
vtk native multi-block datasets instead of simulating multi-block with
multiple outputs and multiple parallel pipelines. The pvd reader now
outputs a vtkMultiBlockDataSet. The stream tracer should work with
this dataset although possibly somewhat more slowly. I have been
meaning to write an append filter that can take all blocks of a
multi-block dataset and append them to an unstructured grid but I
didn't get around to it yet. If you are interested in writing such a
filter, I can give you pointers.

I'm trying to remotely generate a series of images with paraview

an image without having an active X session. Is there a way to load  
a .pvsm state file and save an image without having any sort of

You have to compile a separate pvserver with offscreen mesa support.
OSMesa does not require an X connection. When configuring this
paraview build, turn on VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA and have the new
variable that shows up point to the OSMesa library. You can download
Mesa at http://www.mesa3d.org/.

Hats off to Mesa developers for making this possible.

Hi everybody,

I'd like to export a dataset from PV using my own format. Ok, I already read
some instructions from VTK and PV books but it would be a good starting
point if anyone could provide me an example. Any C++ code with the
corresponding XML files that could be modified would be really great. For a
non-C++ programmer it's the best way to get used with the language and all
the engine behind constructing and loading plugins within PV.

Thanks for any help

Subject: [Paraview] Colours in AVI Animations looking sub-sampled
Message-ID: <965451.44010.qm@web52712.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I use Paraview 3.3.0 (compiled on 32-bit Linux, and 32-bit Windows machines) from CVS, and have found that when I save an animation with geometry made translucent using the "opacity" option in the usual ".avi" format, I get videos which lack smoothness of colours. 

The gradients are all replaced by discrete colour changes. The translucent parts of my mesh do not display any simulated field... it is purely the geometry, with the default grayish tinge given to the "solid colour" in Paraview. However, the fields I display also end up being "colour discretised" once exported to AVI. 

The geometry and the fields look perfectly fine within the Paraview GUI.

It this something to do with the AVI video format... or the 256 colour limitation in the "view settings" option? Or am I doing something wrong ?

Have a nice day!

Regards,

Philippose

One bit of advise tho, I'm programatically generating my data files, do 
you suggest I write an XML writer or I use a library like Xerces?

A few weeks ago I wrote a C routine to write a vtp file and another to 
write a vti file (XML format). Both used the "appended" and "raw" 
formats for efficiency. Therefore I didn't need to deal with any special 
encoding. It was easy.

Thanks, I'm having a look at a sample VTU file (not vtp) as we speak. 
It's not too bad. I'm sure I'll have questions ...

Subject: [Paraview] paraview crashes in VTK with > 2^31 points
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0711221220380.4989@lbox203.mpikg.mpg.de>


Hello,

does paraview (resp. VTK) support data sets of
more than 2^31 points on 64bit x86 ?

I am using a raw file with dimension
1630x1250x1520 of 8bit-points.

During file reading paraview crashes with SIGFAULT.
The crash seems based on a wrong 'int' calculation in

    vtkImageData::AllocateScalars().

After first attempt of fixing it roughly

/*
     scalars->SetNumberOfTuples((extent[1] - extent[0] + 1)*
                                (extent[3] - extent[2] + 1)*
                                (extent[5] - extent[4] + 1));
*/
     scalars->SetNumberOfTuples((long)(extent[1] - extent[0] + 1)*
                                (long)(extent[3] - extent[2] + 1)*
                                (long)(extent[5] - extent[4] + 1));


the file is read fine now, but paraview does not display
any points. On the other hand arrays of 400x400x400
are displayed perfectly. Maybe there are more such bugs
in paraview components. At least the above bug is still
present in current CVS VTK tree.

Any idea how to debug this situation and fix it completely
is appreciated.

Did you compile paraview with VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS? By default, VTK (and
hence ParaView) uses a signed int as n id type, restricting number of
points/cells to 2^31. If you compile with VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS turned on,
VTK will use the appropriate 64 bit integer as id type. However, there
are still some bugs where certain things do not work with 2^31. We
haven't tracked all of them down. If you run into issues, please post
a report on this list describing what happened in detail.

VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS is used and vtkIdType is 64bit 'long'.
The mentioned bug is related to 'int' type of extent[] values
and calculating the number of tuples before invoking
SetNumberOfTuples().

see vtkImageData::AllocateScalars()

   1630*1250*1520 results in -1197967296 as number of tuples

Fixing this calculation as mentioned in previous email removes the
crash, but when turning on volume representation no points are displayed. 
I am using the MPI version with --use-offscreen-rendering on 64 nodes. 
I can move my box and modify the color map but nothing is displayed.

I am very new to paraview and would appreciate any further hint
how to track down why no points are displayed. All goes well with
400x400x400 samples.

Which OS and which compiler are you on?  Does it use LP64, ILP64, LLP64.
etc?  See:

If that fixes it, then I'm guessing that on your system int and long are
a different size.  Probably Linux or Mac OS X?

You seem to have found a genuine overflow, but casting to long is not
the best fix, since in an LLP64 system both are 32 bit.

I have looked briefly at the state of VTK wrt 64 bit, and in my opinion
there is a lot of work to be done.  How to fix it completely?  I don't
know how much kitware has investigated the whole thing, but maybe
something should be started here:

Dear all!

In version 2.6 of paraview it is possible to load cas and dat file from
fluent directly.

I'm wondering if this feature could be included also in paraview 3!
Can I add in some way this reader?

Many thanks!

I was told that paraview 3.2 doesn't support --reverse-connect or -rc. But 
"pvserver --help" still shows it as a valid option. Can anyone confirm 
whether or not this feature is supported in 3.2 or later?

It will be available in the next version (3.2.2). Until them, you can
enable it using the plugin functionality (if you are brave enough :-)

I did a quick test, which shows a problem with --reverse-connect. The test 
used paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86 pre-compiled binary.

I have two linux computers, let's call them A and B.
(1) I tried "forward" connection and it works:
     "pvserver" on B; then "paraview --server=B" on A
or
     "pvserver" on A; then "paraview --server=A" on B
(2) Then, I tried reverse connection, and it FAILED:
     "paraview" on A; then "pvserver -rc -ch=A" on B
or
     "paraview" on B; then "pvserver -rc -ch=B" on A

Is the above (2) the right way to launch paraview in client/server mode 
using reverse connection?

It works fine for me in ParaView 3.2.1.  Just open up the animation view
(View -> Animation View), add a track for the isosurfaces parameter of
the contour filter, and click play.

Reverse connection should work just fine in 3.2.  I use it all the time
to connect to our visualization servers through the ParaView GUI.  I'm
pretty sure our support staff has also got it working using the command
line options of ParaView 3.2.0 (our internal distribution of 3.2.1 is
not yet complete).

I can think of a couple of things that might have gone wrong.

1. Are you sure you told the client to do a reverse connection as well
as the server?  If you did not tell the client (the paraview executable)
to do a reverse connection, then both sides will try to connect to the
other and no one will be listening for a connection.

2. Did you start the client first?  When doing a reverse connection, the
client must already be started and waiting for a connection before
starting the server.  If you try to start the server before the client
is ready, it may fail to connect and then give up before the client
starts waiting for the connection.

here is what you should have. in your home directory, check the file
~/.config/ParaView/servers.pvsc

this file gets created after you configure your servers from within
paraview. You can also edit it by hand if you want to do the same config
for many nodes.

this is one possible configuration of your host for default connection

?<Server name="B" resource="cs://B"> <ManualStartup/> </Server>

this is one for reverse connection

?<Server name="Brc" resource="csrc://B:11111"> <ManualStartup/>

with this given "manual startup connection", you may

1) start the server on B waiting for A (command pvserver), then run the
paraview client on A (paraview --server=B)

or

2) start the paraview client on A, waiting for B like this:? paraview
--server=Brc
and from B, give the command: pvserver -rc

I just tried that on our server and got connected without problems.
Starting the X server on your paraview server node(s)? is left as an
exercise.

But to my surprise, I could not animate yet. What I did is

Isosurface generation:
-------------------------------------
- click Contour
- click New Range
- enter 10 in Steps
- click OK
- click Apply
I generated 10 isosurfaces.

Animation
---------------------------
- click View
- clicke Animation Inspector
- Enter 0 in Current Time
- Enter 0 Start Time
- Enter 10 in End Time
- Ply Mode Sequence
- No of Frames 10
- Selected Object Contour1
- Property to Animate Isosurfaces
- click Play

Does not animate anything. Do I have to do anything else? Of course I
tried with different play modes and adding key frames also, but
nothing happens! In use both 3.2.1 and 3.1.0.

Try creating just one isosurface in the contour filter.

The animation may be confused because it is expecting to animate one
isosurface value and you have given it 10.  It may also be the case that
one of the isosurface values is being animated but you cannot see it
because it is being obscured by the others.  I have not really played
with trying to animate with multiple contours defined because it
generally does not sound like a good idea (and was probably not your
intention).

Did you add key frames to tell it how to animate the isosurfaces, before 
you hit play?

Subject: [Paraview] Library Linking
Message-ID: <f6b6a4db11cb0.474b1618@itv.rwth-aachen.de>

Hello ParaView Developers,

I'm wondering how ParaView does the library linking.
The binary is just ~75k, so it definitely doesn't use static linking. But all over the net it says that precompiled binaries in linux need static linked libraries (which results in a huge binary file).
I see that ParaView comes with a bunch of libraries in the /lib folder. If I try this in my own project, it still doesn't work on other distributions. It seems as if the linker uses system libraries before the ones I supplied in my application directory.
I took a look at the ParaView code but didn't see anything that helped my to understand. So, how did you solve this?

Regards,
Christian Remy

You don't *need* static linking to distribute binaries on Linux.

The paraview binary is just a wrapper that sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the lib 
folder.  So if there is a library on the system *and* in the paraview lib 
folder, the one in the paraview lib folder is used.
Some other projects use a shell script to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH then invoke the 
real executable.

You may also want to read up on LSB.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base
If you use rpm/deb, you don't have to ship a copy of the system libraries for 
your application.

Subject: [Paraview] Understanding the PVSM File from 3.2.1
Message-ID: <474B1270.2030508@psc.edu>

We'll be using these files for some batch work so I thought I'd look through 
one just once. A few questions.

1) Documentation of the PVSM

In a few cases its obvious how to understand what needs to go into this file if 
you read about the corresponding C++ class. But there are many other cases 
where that doesn't seem to be the case.

Is there a documentation of the PVSM file somewhere? Or is one never to edit it 
directly? Editing is almost always needed for batch work.

2) Why so much boilerplate?

There is a huge section defining things that I didn't change: lookup tables, 
camera manipulators and simple sources. Don't paraview and pvbatch already know 
all this? Why not include only changes?

3) Orphan End Tags

Inside the ServerManagerState section there end tags

     <CompoundProxyDefinitions/>
     <Links/>

with no corresponding start tags. A bug? Most XML interpreters would get rather 
upset about this.

TIA!

This is completely valid xml. End tags start with / not end with it.
<foo/> means that the xml element is opened and closed in one tag.

No good reason other than code simplicity. It is easier to simply dump
the whole state rather than checking if  elements were modified.

The easiest way of doing this may be to load the state in python, make
the appropriate changes to proxies/properties through python and dump
a new state. This way, you won't have to learn details of the pvsm
format (which tends to be complicated).

I didn't start paraview client as -rc is not a valid option for the 
client. How to tell the client to do reverse connection?

Hi Jean,

Thank you for responding to my question...

I have the file on both computers, each of which specifies the other 
computer as Server with ManualStartup. (Note: here the two computers are 
not part of our SVA, they are two computers in my office running linux 
box and X server is up and running)

I did this successfully, but this is referred to as "forward" connection, 
right?

Right after issuing "paraview --server=Brc (before "pvserver -rc" on B), 
a error dialog pops up, saying

ERROR: In 
/home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/VTK/Parallel/vtkClientSocket.cxx,

Could not connect to requested server " stereo3d ". Creating default

I always use the ParaView GUI or XML to specify the client connections.
In the XML, you change the resource to start with "csrc:" instead of
"cs:".  I don't know how to do it from the command line.  Perhaps Berk
or Alan can speak up here.

Here's how I do it:

1. In the paraview GUI (started normally), click the connect icon.
2. In the box that pops up, click on Add a server
3. The name can be whatever you would like (we use "Manual"). Server
Type should be "Client/Server (reverse connection)". Host and port can
be left alone.
4. Hit Configure
5. "Startup Type:" should be "Manual"
6. Hit "Save"
7. Exit the client
8. Start the client from the command line with "paraview
--server=Manual" If you named the server differently in step 3, use that
name instead.
9. Start the server with "pvserver -rc -ch=<client machine>"

This will modify the XML file specified below in your home directory to
include the items necessary for reverse-connection from the command
line.

On the client side, create a server called Manual.  Another option is to
create a default_servers.pvsc file, and place it in lib/paraview-3.2.
Put the following text into this file:

<Server name="Manual" owner="user" resource="csrc://localhost" >
 <ManualStartup/>
</Server>


Client side:
  paraview --server=Manual

Our servers use a qsub to get some nodes, then mpiexec paraview server
on each of these nodes.  Here is the pvserver string:

Server side (on each node):

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering -rc -ch=${REMHOST_NAME}

Thanks, Kenneth. Jean also made it clear in his reply. I just overlooked 
the difference between "cs" and "csrc" in .config/ParaView/servers.pvsc. 
Now the problem is solved. Thanks again.

Hi Stephane,

The implementation is complicated enough that I am not comfortable
including in a patch release. This will be in 3.4 that will be
available in a few months.

Subject: [Paraview] Animations with multiple .pvts files
Message-ID: <20071126.164009.159683660.walter@geodynamics.org>

Greetings,

I have a number of pvts (and associated vts) files numbered

fields.00000.pvts
fields.00010.pvts
fields.00020.pvts
...

I can read them in individually, but I can not, for the life of me,
figure out how to animate them with the 3.2.1 Linux binary.  I try to
select them all in the file open dialog, but I only end up getting one
of the files (fields.00000.pvts).  Then, in the Animation Inspector,
the only options I am given for "Property to Animate" is Cell Arrays
and Point Arrays.

I was able to animate with the 2.6.1 release because it automatically
figured out that there were multiple time steps.  With 3.0.2, it is
mostly the same as 3.2.1 except I now get an option of "File Name" in
"Property to Animate".  Selecting that does not give me anything,
though.  If I add a keyframe, then trying to run the animation crashes
the 3.0.2 executable.  I don't know if it matters, but multiple
timesteps will not fit in memory.

I feel like I am missing some really basic step.

Thanks,
Walter Landry

Actually, what you want is already supported, and the best way to do it is by 
adding a hint.

 <SourceProxy name="name" class="vtkname">
 ...
     <Hints>
       <Property name="FileName" show="1"/>
     </Hints>
 </SourceProxy>

Many thanks for the information.

I think I am confused with the isosurface animation what I mean and
what paraview does. In fact I was trying to display different
isosurfaces in a sequence that I create in contour. And I am not
really sure whether it is possible in paraview.

but this wont work in 3.X versions no more , every time i try to connect to a server with the connect option i only can connect to data and render server and it says: cannot connect to any render server .
can anybody tell me what is the cause ?

In paraview 3, we disabled support for file series when a file format
supports time. The easiest way of solving your problem is to write a
pvd file that points to your pvts files, one per time step. pvd is a
meta format that points to one or more .vtX or .pvtX files. It can be
used to group multiple files or create time series out of multiple
files. There has been quite a few e-mails on pvd file format on this
mailing list so look at the archives for more information. I am not
sure if someone had time to put this information on the wiki yet.
Maybe someone will volunteer :-)

Hi Clint,

your mail sounded that interesting, that I tried to use LSB 3.0 for my
Qt4 application, too. I downloaded the lsb3.0.rpms and tried to compile
Qt4.3.2 using the platform-spec-file "linux-lsb-g++" delivered with Qt4

But :( Qt4 could not compile with lsb-3.0. It fails because the command
'fstatf()' is not supported by lsb-3.0.

What lsb-version is paraview using?
Does Qt4 need some modification to compile with lsb?

Thanks for any help/comments

Greetings
Jens

ParaView binaries aren't using LSB.  I was just bringing it up in case 
your app failed to run on other distributions because of using 
distribution specific features (but that might be less likely now that 
you say you're using Qt).

I've seen a few big projects successfully distributing binaries with 
shared libraries for several linux distributions (without LSB).  The 
main issue is to package your shared libraries that you don't want to 
assume the user has (or don't want to assume the system would have 
compatible ones), and use LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

The LSB Qt4 module looks like it is for Qt 4.1.  If you want to use 
this, but have problems, you probably need to ask the Qt or LSB folks.

If you're using Qt, then you probably want to read up on this 
http://doc.trolltech.com/deployment.html
It talks about the LD_LIBRARY_PATH thing among others.

Resending this in hopes that someone has a suggestion, but missed the 
first attempt.

Have you tried:

// application core (manager of managers) for paraview
pqApplicationCore* appCore = pqApplicationCore::instance();
// server manager model for querying items in the server manager
pqServerManagerModel* smModel = appCore->getServerManagerModel();
// get all the pqRenderView instances.
QList<pqRenderView*> renderViews = smModel->findItems<pqRenderView>();

The pqRenderView gives you access to the vtkSMRenderViewProxy and the 
QVTKWidget attached to it, as well as image capture routines.

Subject: [Paraview] 3.2.1 Client-Server Render Errors and Crash
Message-ID: <474DE9E9.3040107@psc.edu>

This looks like bug #4368 that I first reported for 2.4.4.

When operating in client-server mode, and the server is rendering, there are 
rendering errors. Plus, when I try to set the center-of-rotation, the server 
crashes. Neither problem occurs when rendering on the client.

I've attached an image generated by File->Screenshot which matches what is seen 
on the screen. The crash messages are below. I saved the core dump.

To reproduce the problem I load the vtu file and display its outer surface. 
This surface is modest with 38712 cells and 19106 points. Next I turn off the 
display of the center-of-rotation, zoom in and out, and the rendering problem 
occurs. Finally I try to set the center-of-rotation to a point on the 
badly-rendered surface and the server crashes.

This, for us, is a serious problem as we and one of our users display this type 
of data often.

TIA!

Jordi,

Your Dump.py script looks like a tool that could be really useful to me.
However, when using the script with PV3.2.0 (with several sources and
filters created) I only get the output listed below (and which doesn't even
run).
Do you know what am I doing wrong?

Thanks you.

The Dump.py script was designed using the old python interface to paraview.
3.2 introduced the new servermanager python interface, and nobody has
developed a new Dump.py that works with it.

The rendering artifacts look like it might be related to problems with
the clipping range.  What are the physical dimensions of the object
(that is, what does the Information panel report in the Bounds box)?

Is it possible to send us your data to play with?

Hi Jean,

We finally made Paraview 3.2 run on our SVA. Both forware and reverse 
connections are tested, and they all work. However, there are some 
issues:

(1) When using reverse connect, it prints out the following error:

ICET,0:ERROR: Sizes of src and dest do not agree.

every time Paraview refreshes its rendering.

(2) Right after "sva_paraview.sh -l -r 2"

There will be warning/error message:
Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding.
/usr/X11R6/bin/xauth:  error in locking authority file /home/guanw/.Xauthority

no matter I issue "unset XAUTHORITY" and "module load mpi/hp" or not.

(3) Except for the first render node, all the the other render nodes 
consume 100% CPU constantly.

Below I copy/paste sva_paraview.appfile.xxxxx files for your review. 
Thanks.

Weiguang

That error usually occurs when the available display on node 0 is larger
than one or more of the other displays in your cluster.  I'm surprised
this only happens in reverse connect, it generally has nothing to do
with the direction of the connection.  At any rate, work with your
system administrators to make sure X Windows is set up to have the same
size display on all nodes in your cluster.

I dunno.  Maybe your system administrators can help you hash out issues
with X Windows permissions.

That is not uncommon with some implementations of MPI.  When the server
is sitting at idle, node 0 is listening for a socket while all others
are sitting in an MPI_Recv call.  Some implementations of MPI must
implement MPI_Recv in a loop that constantly polls for incoming data (I
guess).  At any rate there is nothing we can really do about it.

I think you are right. It's likely that I did the forward and reverse 
connection tests, one before and the other after our SVA was reconfigured.

Does this affect the performance of paraview? Can we consider it as a bug 
of MPI lib (we use HP MPI lib)?

No, it does not effect the performance of ParaView.  It just might warm
up your cluster a bit.

I need to checkout the development version of  paraview from cvs, but my PC
is under firewall.
How can I  avoid this obstacle?
Maybe using ssh tunnel?

Thank you Michele

Dear All,

I want to visualise stream tracer with tube filter in a volume rended 3d

stream lines  (tubes)  are no longer seen as tubes but like flattend . How
do I do this?  I think I want to generate something like this :

	Using the Probe Filter with point data, without cell data
Message-ID: <475010A5.7040607@litec.csic.es>

Hello Paraview's users,

I create a ".vtk file" but when I use Paraview in order to see it and, 
there, I use the filter called "Probe" that
takes the values over a line, I don't obtain continuous values because I 
don't have written the "cell data" only ""point data"

Does exist a fast way in order to create the cell data through my ".vtk 
file" and in that way be able to use Probe without discontinuities?      
       
Thank-you very much in advance
Isa

The streamline filter followed by the tube filter is what you want.  I'm
not sure what you mean by "flattened."  I've never seen anything quite
like that before.

Use the "Point Data To Cell Data Filter". This will average each
cell's point's values to create a cell value for each cell. After that
you can write out the file and/or probe it.

Hi Everyone,

I'm pretty new to ParaView, with a little experience with Pre-3.0 
versions.  I'm trying to get some parallel configurations up and running 
under LInux but am having some problems - some probably pretty basic, 
some maybe not.

My environment is a small cluster, 3 dual-dual-core nodes for a total of 
12 available cores, all running Suse 10.2.  I've got ParaView 3.2.1 
built and installed on all three nodes with parallel capabilities enabled.

My first attempt is to get a single client with four servers running on 
a single node.  Rather than describe all the gyrations I have gone 
through, suffice it to say I have been unsuccessful in getting any more 
than one server to run.  It runs OK, but I need to get multiple servers 
running, connecting to the same client.  I've gone through the wiki 
pages and used my pre-3.0 experiences (where I also had some problems), 
but continue to be unsuccessful. 

I've tried using mpirun manually to start the server and used the 
--reverse-connection option, but only a single connection is ever 
established.  I've tried using the connect dialog but again can only get 
a single instance of the server running and connected.  Is there 
something I need to do to the client to get multiple connections?

Can someone show me how to get this thing configured to run multiple 
servers on a single node as well as multiple servers on multiple nodes? 
Maybe an example of a configuration file?  In the end, I'll be running 
some of this in situations where a firewall may well be involved so will 
probably require the use of the --reverse-connection capabilities.  I'd 
greatly appreciate any and all assistance.

Thanks in advance

Jim

For example, I stored two arrays in h5: A and B.
I want thanks to a formula or function under xdmf an additional

I'm confused about what you are trying to do.  What do you mean by
multiple connections or multiple servers?  ParaView currently only
supports a direct connection between the client and node 0 of the
server.  Node 0 then propagates the client's requests through MPI.  Why
are you trying to make multiple connections between client and server?

When you say multiple servers what do you mean?

In ParaView the client establishes at most two connections at a time.
The usual case is when is connects to a program called pvserver, the
rarer case is when it connects to two programs, the pvrenderserver and
the pvdataserver.

The server or (the two) servers are usually, but not always, message
passing parallel programs that use  MPI to communicate between some
number of processes running copies of the same program. The binary
distributions of paraview are not built with MPI so to run the servers
as parallel programs you must compile from source.

An example of getting everything started is to:
mpirun -np 4 pvserver (this assumes you have built paraview with MPI)
run paraview
go to file connect
create a configuration that specifies where the server is running
connect to it

Yes.  We used to have the same problem, and we solved it with ssh
tunnels.  First, from the computer on which you wish to check out
ParaView (which I will now call the client), run

 

  ssh -L 2401:public.kitware.com:2401 external.host.com

 

where external.host.com is some computer outside of your firewall to
which you have ssh login privilege.  Once the ssh login is complete, any
socket connection to your client on port 2401 will be automatically
rerouted through the ssh connection to public.kitware.com.  It just so
happens that the pserver protocol of cvs uses port 2401.

 

Now to check out ParaView on the client, do so as normally except
replace public.kitware.com (or www.paraview.org) with localhost and your
good to go.

 

     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@localhost:/cvsroot/ParaView3 login

     (respond with empty password)

     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@localhost:/cvsroot/ParaView3 co ParaView3

firewalls are NOT letting port 2401 through? This assumes the user

Well, I do nightly checkouts of ParaView to my computer halfway across
the country from Kitware's servers nightly.  I just checked my access to
cvs and everything is working fine for me.  So presumably the problem is
on your end.  I cannot say with any certainty that the problem is with
your firewall, but it sounds like a reasonable explanation.

replace public.kitware.com (or www.paraview.org) with localhost and your
good to go.

 

     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@localhost:/cvsroot/ParaView3 login

     (respond with empty password)

     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@localhost:/cvsroot/ParaView3 co ParaView3

Subject: [Paraview] cvs under firewall

 

Dear all,

I need to checkout the development version of  paraview from cvs, but my
PC is under firewall.
How can I  avoid this obstacle?
Maybe using ssh tunnel?

Thank you Michele

Thank-you for your answer.
But I tried it before and it doesn't work.
Finally I have found the solution.

I must say that my problem is a 2D design so, first of all, I have to 
use Cut Filter and later use Prober Filter over the Cut obtained.
In that way I obtain a number of points that joining them with a line 
paints the correct value independent on the resolution I put.

I thought it was completely necessary to have cell data values in order 
to get a good representation through Probe filter, but I realize that it 
is independent on this fact.

Thank-you very much
Isa

It indicates that the X server on your cluster is not set up to allow
MPI jobs like pvserver to create render windows.  You need to change the
permissions on your X server.

Hi Ken,

Thanks for the clarification.  I misunderstood what types and the number
of connections that would actually be created.  What you just described
is exactly what I am seeing.  One connection to Node 0 of the server.

Now everything appears to be OK with a single server.  When I run the
server in parallel using mpirun, I get a message indicating "Display is
not accessible on the server side.  Remote rendering will be disabled."
Does this indicate I need to use offscreen rendering when running in
parallel?  I've got dual video cards on each node and would like to take
advantage of these.

Thanks again for you help.

Jim

I'm confused about what you are trying to do.  What do you mean by
multiple connections or multiple servers?  ParaView currently only
supports a direct connection between the client and node 0 of the
server.  Node 0 then propagates the client's requests through MPI.  Why
are you trying to make multiple connections between client and server?

	Hi Everyone,
	 
	I'm pretty new to ParaView, with a little experience with
Pre-3.0
	versions.  I'm trying to get some parallel configurations up and
	    

running
  

	under LInux but am having some problems - some probably pretty
basic,
	some maybe not.
	 
	My environment is a small cluster, 3 dual-dual-core nodes for a
total
	    

of
  

	12 available cores, all running Suse 10.2.  I've got ParaView
3.2.1
	built and installed on all three nodes with parallel
capabilities
	    

enabled.
  

	My first attempt is to get a single client with four servers
running
	    

on
  

	a single node.  Rather than describe all the gyrations I have
gone
	through, suffice it to say I have been unsuccessful in getting
any
	    

more
  

	than one server to run.  It runs OK, but I need to get multiple
	    

servers
  

	running, connecting to the same client.  I've gone through the
wiki
	pages and used my pre-3.0 experiences (where I also had some
	    

problems),
  

	but continue to be unsuccessful.
	 
	I've tried using mpirun manually to start the server and used
the
	--reverse-connection option, but only a single connection is
ever
	established.  I've tried using the connect dialog but again can
only
	    

get
  

	a single instance of the server running and connected.  Is there
	something I need to do to the client to get multiple
connections?
	 
	Can someone show me how to get this thing configured to run
multiple
	servers on a single node as well as multiple servers on multiple
	    

nodes?
  

	Maybe an example of a configuration file?  In the end, I'll be
running
	some of this in situations where a firewall may well be involved
so
	    

will
  

	probably require the use of the --reverse-connection
capabilities.
	    

I'd
  

	greatly appreciate any and all assistance.
	 
	Thanks in advance
	 
	Jim

The documentation file pqClient.adp mentions this file, but I can't find 
it anywhere in the distribution.  Not a big deal, but something that may 
want to be fixed.
