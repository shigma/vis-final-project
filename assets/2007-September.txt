Unfortunately, that feature has not been added to ParaView 3 yet.  It is
registered as bug #5422.

Message-ID: <3813.128.138.45.92.1188805778.mynet@webmail100.mynet.com>

Dear all,

I have recently installed paraview
2.4.4 using mpi-lam.7.1.3 on a linux cluster. And l am trying to use it
remotely. I can run it using "mpirun -np 1 paraview" for small size
Ensight Gold files. However, when l use multiple processors l am having
problem. I am seeing some other windows when it is reading the data
files. Probably rendering part... Is this not to way to run it
remotely?
Actually what l want to do is to
visulize an Ensight Gold file with around 8million vertices. On the net
l saw that there is a pvserver option to run it when you have a poor
client machine. However, for this one first l need to install it on
client machine as well. Then l will run pvserver on the clusternodes.
However, l do not have a direct acces from the client to the cluster
nodes. Everthing has to go trough frontal node. I wonder whether you
people had simillar problems and how you handle it?

Best wishes,

Message-ID: <1188822060.4170.39.camel@easy-rider.ee.ethz.ch>

Hello.

I have downloaded the paraview binaries, and am running them on Fedora
7.  While it seems to be working well for the most part, I am unable to
open hdf5 file (written by MEEP).  Attempting to do so yields the
following error messages:

ERROR:

I have been unable to find any mention of this online.  Is this a bug,
or a problem with my system configuration?   If I change the files to
vtk using h5tovtk, I have no problem opening the data.

Thanks for your help.

This is not a bug. The hdf5 image reader can read only a very
specialized subset of hdf5 files. Because of the flexible nature of
hdf5, it is almost impossible to support all formats written using
hdf5. You should probably look at the Xdmf reader. It can read many
hdf5 formats. It requires writing an xml file describing what the hdf5
file contains. Documentation is at xdmf.org.

Message-ID: <1b61cab90709031659s47f1b2dcldb7a23a7bd3de12d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

>From the thread "PV3: Animation from legacy VTK timewise files", I
learned that the CVS ParaView can automatically detect a file series
of legacy-vtk files for making animation.

However, PV3 compiled from the CVS source retrieved in the following
way doesn't do such detection.
  % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.paraview.org:/cvsroot/ParaView3 login
  % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.paraview.org:/cvsroot/ParaView3 co ParaView3
My platform is Mac OS X PPC and the compiled PV3 says that its version is 3.1.0.

Does this mean that the CVS source I got is not the latest one? If so,
could you tell me how I can get the latest CVS source?

Thank you.

I am assuming you named your files with a certain pattern? What does
the pattern look like? We currently support:

foo.<int>.vtk
foo<int>vtk
<int>foo.vtk

where <int> is an integer with any number of leading zeros.

Is it possible to merge coincident points in PV? I have some pieces of the
same models that I would like to apply filters as it were an unique dataset.
I already tried "group datasets" in PV-2.6.2 but it only groups without
merging the points. I also tried to "Convert to simple dataset" over the
"group datasets" result but PV crashed. The "append datasets" should do it
but it is disabled. Is there any other filter to try?

Thanks 

Renato.

Yes, In /usr/share/ParaView/.

Sounds like you're using the development branch.
You may want to update it to be sure you get the latest changes related 
to this.

You'll need to use "append datasets" followed by "clean to grid". You'll need 
to understand why "append" is disabled. As a test make a sphere and cylinder 
and see if "append" is enabled.

I am guessing one of the datasets is a multi-block dataset. Append
cannot handle those. There is no easy of appending blocks of a
multi-block dataset in paraview, I am afraid. This is a useful feature
so I will add a feature request to the bug tracker for 3.4. It is
possible to do this using vtk (with maybe python or tcl wrappers).
What is the use case? You need to apply some other filter that
requires merging points, I am guessing...

I recently added a Wiki page that describes how to set up ParaView client/server.  I wrote it for ParaView 3, but most of the information should be applicable to ParaView 2.  The biggest difference is that you will use a program called pvclient rather than paraview on the client side.

 

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

 

Read through that and then ask more specific questions.

Message-ID: <b45d6a1e0709041358q49086414qd02898b2fc9e373f@mail.gmail.com>

The previous version of the state loader script I released previously was
designed around the old python wrappings. With the new and improved
servermanager wrappings released, I decided to update the script to handle
the better way of doing things. The biggest improvement was the total
removal of all eval commands from the script, which makes me allot happier.

Even if you don't really need the script, it should provide a decent
overview of the numerous new commands, and style of the servermanager
wrappings.

#!/usr/bin/env python

from paraview.servermanager import *
import cPickle as pickle

class State:
  '''Allows the user to save states, which is all the display properties for
each Pipeline object and camera. After saving
  states you can than load them back up, reverting all the object and camera
properties to what they where
  on saving. The set of views can also be saved to a file by using pickle so
that you can build up multiple viewStates
  and than display them at a latter time

  Currently Supports:
    saving a state by calling
      addView(statename) statename can be numeric / string

    Loading a state:
      loadView(statename) will load the respective state. If nothing changes
      click on the render window of paraview, that should fix the render
display.

    Extra Commands:
      deleteView(name), will delete the view
      deleteAllViews, will clear the view list
      renameView(oldName, newName), renames the view currently called
oldName, to newName
      containsView(name), Will tell you if the name is already being used by
a view
      listViews(), Will list all the names of the views currently made
      debugView(name), Will dump the properties of the view, for testing

    Pickle Saving all States:
      saveState(filepath+filename) will pickle all the states so that you
can load them up at a different time

      loadState(filepath+filename) will unpickle all the states so that you
can run previously generated states

    Bug:
      Currently items added after a view is stored are not turned off/on
when loading view that do not effect
      that item. This may or may not be helpfull to you

I got the following errors when trying to build Paraview 3.1 with cmake 
2.4.

/home/guanw/visualization/software/src/ParaView3/VTK/Common/vtkType.h:154:3: 
#error "No native data type can represent an 8-bit integer."

/home/guanw/visualization/software/src/ParaView3/VTK/Common/vtkType.h:212:3: 
#error "No native data type can represent a 32-bit floating point value."

Considering just the second error, I find that 
ParaView3/VTK/CMakeLists.txt:SET(VTK_SIZEOF_SHORT ${CMAKE_SIZEOF_SHORT}). 
And CMAKE_SIZEOF_SHORT should be set by CHECK_TYPE_SIZE(short 
CMAKE_SIZEOF_SHORT) in 
ParaView3/VTK/CMake/CMakeBackwardCompatibilityC.cmake, but it didn't do 
so. Below is a section in my CMakeCache.txt. Can you tell me what is 
wrong?

Subject: [Paraview] save as ply
Message-ID: <3718.193.206.188.16.1189011262.squirrel@webmail.fe.infn.it>

Hi all,my name is Andrea, i'm new to the list.
I need to convert a vrml file to acis or iges format.

At this page
http://home.austin.rr.com/reubenrachel/reuben/3D/
it is suggested to convert vrml file into ply format, and then convert the
obtained file into iges format.

I've installed paraview, opened the vrml file and applied Delaunay 2D filter.
This correctly render the vrml file.
Now i need to save the file as ply format.
I select file-->save data, but i can save only as vtm format, ply is not
present. Why this ? Any help ?

Best regards,
Andrea

I know that I found the original dump tool really great tool to have around
when working in paraview. Unfortunately it seems that recently it was
broken, and I have seen a working copy posted again. So I quickly wrote up

OK, I've solved the problem by building cmake from source instead of using 
the cmake binary distribute.

Subject: [Paraview] use state on client
Message-ID: <46DF48D9.2090905@gmx.de>

Hi,

I just tested paraview 3.1 Server/Client ability, which
worked nice so far loading some vtk files, but unfortunately
I could not load any state file.  The state file choosing
directory is local on the client machine and not as expected
on the server... Maybe, someone has an idea, how to fix this!?

Greetings
Fabian

This is not something to fix. By design, paraview state is saved to
and loaded from the client side. This is also the way it was with all
previous versions of ParaView.

Hi Berk,

thanks for the quick reply.
Is there a different way to prepare some visualization and
showing it in a different place on a different
system? Maybe, it wold be enough to adjust somehow the file
path to the remote machine in the state file?

Regards!
Fabian

Subject: [Paraview] paraview - trajectories using Ensight format
Message-ID: <825624.28545.qm@web30609.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello all

I have to write a Fortran program that write data in EnsightGold format. The data consists in approx 200 000 particles for each one its trajectory (90 000 points for each trajectory) and the corresponding temperature and velocity. 

Does anybody have a Fortran (C) subroutine that do such a thing, or any other similar example ?

Can anybody help me?

Thank you.

Alberto.

Subject: [Paraview] Structured Grid Blanking and Scalar Ranges
Message-ID: <46E02355.8020605@users.sourceforge.net>

I'm working on a new reader that creates a vtkStructuredGrid and sets
the point visibility array for invalid values.  It works fine, except 
that it doesn't affect the scalar ranges.  Looking at the code, I can 
see that vtkPVArrayInformation does indeed not take the blanking array 
into account for structured grids.  It also looks like changing that 
behavior would be involved, as it processes each scalar array without 
regard to its respective containing data set, so I'm not going to worry 
about that just yet.

Is there some other way to set the scalar range manually?

Preferably in such a way that the manual range is maintained when passed
through filters, but that's probably a bit much to ask.

I'm working with 3.1.0 right now, but I'm willing to switch to head if 
necessary.

Thanks,
Sean

Hmmmm. Tricky. The right way of dealing with this is probably adding a
ComputeRange() to vtkDataSet (that takes the array) and ask it to
compute the range. Each sub-class could then take blanking into
account. This would involve quite a few changes, I am afraid.

I dealt with the same issue in my custom readers by setting the blanked, 
invalid values to zero or something within the valid range.

I had considered that.  The only problem is that it creates incorrect 
results in other filters.  One example is histogram (which also ignores 
blank values), where if you set the invalid values to something within 
the range you wouldn't be able to tell if it were valid or invalid 
values showing up.

I was able to add the blank array as an actual data array.  So I could 
set the values as you suggest.  And as a kludge, I can threshold the 
data set based on the blank array then do things like histogram.  Its a 
bit cumbersome going to an unstructured grid like that, but I guess it 
will have to do for now.

Thanks,
Sean

I have a small lib, compiled and tested with F90 and C++ compilers,
which does just that. Write particles coordinates and their associated
data + the case file all in binary EnSight Gold, and it is constantly
tested against EnSight v8.2.6 and ParaView 3.1. Anyone interested drop
me a personal email

Message-ID: <B7ECE986-D16B-4418-B587-1486B1AF8067@gmail.com>

I just downloaded ParaView from CVS Head ran across the latest  
stumbling block. It seems that Qt 4.2.3 is now Required as the ONLY  
version of Qt. Before I was using 4.3.0 without any problems because  
I was using some of the newer features of Qt 4.3 in some other  
projects. Now I have to have BOTH Qt versions built on my computer.
   I can see both sides to this. On the one hand as paraview  
developers you only want to _support_ a specific version of Qt so the  
number of Bugs is manageable. But could the definition of _support_  
be so that I can still compile against Qt 4.3 but if I submit a bug  
against Qt 4.3 you can ignore it or place it at low priority? Was  
there something added into ParaView 3 that just does not work with Qt  
4.3?

Just another thing I had to do before trying to solve another bug..

Mike,

As you guessed, that check was put in to discourage use of any but the
officially supported version of Qt.  In the early days of ParaView, back
when Tcl/Tk was used for the GUI (and more), there were a lot of
problems with users building with different versions of Tcl.  Eventually
the problem was solved with embedding a version of Tcl/Tk with the
source of ParaView.  Now that we have moved to Qt, licensing and build
issues prevent us from doing that.  Instead we need to make it very
clear to builders which version of Qt ParaView currently supports.

The problem is not so much reporting bugs that are tied to a different
version of Qt.  The problem is not knowing the bug is tied to a
different version of Qt.  If you build with a different version of Qt
and run into a problem there is no practical way to determine that
changes in the Qt library caused problems or not.

So changing the CMake files to allow you to build with Qt 4.3 is easy
enough.  You just need to delete a few lines.  We expect users who are
savvy enough to do that.  But at the same time, the process should come
as a warning that you have a "hacked" version of ParaView that may
experience unforeseen problems.

All a very good idea, and for the most part I agree totally with the  
logic. Would it be possible to put in an "over ride" as an advanced  
option into the CMakeLists file? Then I don't have to "hack" but  
still have the understanding that I am building a NON-supported  
version of ParaView? Or Allow Experimental Qt Support? Or Something?

Thanks

Hi,

I have recently moved to paraview 3.02 (and tried 3.10) and I have 
trouble with the option "Save Animation". When I save an animation, the 
first couple of frames appear to be fine, but the rest of the animation 
is empty; just a black screen.

The rendering appears to be off-screen. I use linux with an NVIDIA 
GeForce 6200 LE, with the proprietary NVIDIA drivers installed.

How can I get a saved animation?

Thanks,

Berend.

Another approach: ensure that the developers know what they have been asked to fix.

1) Require that any bug be submitted with a copy of the CMakeCache.txt file 
used to build that version of PV. The report will not be accepted without it.

2) Add an option such as "paraview -builder" that prints a date, a system name 
and a few other things unique to that build of PV. The binary distribution will 
yield one message while a private build will yield another (which will also be 
somewhere in the CMakeCache.txt file).

These steps would alert the developers that Mike is trying to fool them into 
fixing a Qt 22.0 build :) as well as any other strangeness that should be the 
user's responsibility.

To verify that offscreen rendering is causing the problem, look at
ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMRenderViewProxy.cxx, the function
CaptureWindow(). Comment out the two SetOffScreenRendering() methods
and recompile. If it works, that means that offscreen rendering is at
fault.

Hi folks,

I have been working on a new python module for paraview called
servermanager. This is meant to be a replacement for the paraview
module. Detailed documentation for this module is here:

Please keep in mind that the python interface is still growing and

Dear all,

I am confused with the vtk XML StructuredGrid data file format. For instance
I tried to plot one cube with following data file:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="StructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<StructuredGrid WholeExtent="0 1 0 1 0 1">

0.750000
1.000000
0.000000
0.500000
1.000000
</DataArray>
</PointData>
<Points>
<DataArray type = "Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii">

0.0         1.0          1.0
1.0         1.0          1.0
</DataArray>
</Points>
</Piece>
</StructuredGrid>
</VTKFile>

I could not plot it and got errors. Where can I find the ASCII vtk XML
StructuredGrid data file example? I think I did not understand WholeExtent
and Extent clearly.
Thanks in advance.

It's not in the binary release either. How to run ParaView in

You now use the paraview application for both standalone and
client/server.  The reason for the change is that now you can both
connect and disconnect from a ParaView server from within the paraview
application.

Hi Weiguang,

There is no pvclient in ParaView 3; use paraview instead. It works as 
the client in client/server mode as well as running the full application 
in stand-alone mode.

ParaView 3.x.x does not have a client formally because the client conection is
setup inside the software after it's launched.

It has been rolled into the paraview application. Start up paraview and
navigate to File->Connect to connect to (or start up and then connect to) a
server.

Yes. The VTK reader will use just one processor, I believe, but D3 can be used 
to distribute its output.

Thanks for the instant replies from Kenneth, Amy, Renato, and David. 
Paraview 3 makes it easier to run in client/server mode. More flexible 
too.

Actually, not exactly true. If the data is unstructured (polydata or
unstructured grid), the first node will read the whole dataset, break
it into pieces and distributed to other processes. After that,
everything will work in parallel. If the data is structured, all nodes
will read the whole thing but keep only a portion of it. After that
everything will work in parallel.

Berk and Kent,
Thanks for the quick response,

The data is unstructured and written one file/processor.
file001.vtk
file002.vtk
...
file128.vtk (total processors = 128)

The total x,y,z field contains 128 blocks (or domains).
1-Can I put the list of the vtk files into a list_meta.vtk file and load
only the  list_meta.vtk file?

2-If I use say 32 processors for the visualization, do all 32 processors
read simultaneously (processor 1 reads file001.vtk, processor 2 reads
file002.vtk ... etc)? or does one processor read all files?

I should say that I am using ParaView version 1.6.2.
Stephen

No. You can't. Legacy files were never designed to be parallel. You
can load them one at a time. You should convert to using XML-based VTK
format or Exodus. Both of those support distributed data like this
well.
There is a actually a reader than can do this with legacy VTK files
but it hasn't been tested in a looong time. If you are interested, I
can give you some pointers on where to start. But after that, you
would be on your own. As far as we are concerned, that functionality
is dead.

If you use XML-based VTK or Exodus format, each processor will read
m/n files, where m=number of pieces, n=number of processors. In this
case 128/32.

Ouch. I have no idea if any of the information I provided applies to
1.6.2. I am afraid you are in forgotten land :-)

a problem.  If you cannot connect to or from the cluster, there really is no

run

Dear Ken,



I tried reverserse connnection but pvserver at local node cannot locate
client
machine. I also talked with system admin and it seems that neither incomming
nor outgoing connections are possible at the local nodes. I wonder whether
you
have any other suggestion. May be use of frontal machine.



Best wishes,



Mehmet

You can use the reverse connection (-rc) option on both pvserver and
pvclient
to

tell ParaView to connect from server to client. In this case you will also
need
to

add the --client-host option to pvserver to tell where to connect to.

I don't see any way to get this error message 
"vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader (0xc4da958): Unable to open file: 
/tmp/Navier_Stokes4_.ens.pressure.20" with the EnSight case file Mehmet 
lists. There's no way to get that file name from any of the "scalar per 
node" or "vector per node" variable file names listed.

Are you sure that these error messages and this case file go together?

It works fine for me.  I just built ParaView 3.1 this morning.  You of
course have to make sure that the variables are checked off in the
object inspector, but that is no different than ParaView 2.X.

 

One thing that has changed is that the block id is no longer the default
scalar, so that the exodus data will come up with no coloring.  You
should still see all of the scalars listed under the variable selector
combo box, though.

Is there a trick to getting Paraview 3.1.1 to read Exodus files?  I can
load up the data fine in 2.6 ... but I'm not getting any of the scalars
loaded in V 3.1.1.

On a side note, is there an archive of the email traffic that shows up

"Unavailable" refers to the range.  It simply means that ParaView does
not know the range of that variable because you have not yet loaded that
variable into memory.  So the variable itself is available (otherwise it
would not be listed).  Once you select the checkbox next to a variable
and hit apply, the range information will be filled in.

I see that behavior too for element centered scalars.  Even though that part 
of the GUI says "Unavailable," they really were loaded and available, so you 
can use them.

A fix was put it CVS just now so it won't say "Unavailable" anymore.

Hello,

In http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Starting_the_server, it says "... and the 
host or hosts that will be used for the new configuration." in the

If you are setting up a data server / render server type of connection,
you will get separate text edits for each server.  If you are just
setting up for a single server (the default and recommended setup), you
only can specify one host (there is no reason to specify more).  It is
expected that all communication will go through this host.  That host,
of course, may be part of a larger MPI job, but the client will not
communicate directly with any of the other nodes on the server.

If you are trying to set up connections to different independent
servers, then just add multiple servers to the Choose Server dialog box.

Hi folks,

I'm not sure if it's really a PV3/QT problem or some misconfiguration of my
Windows machines but every time I launch PV3 the title bar (that topmost bar
where is written "Kitware ParaView 3.1.0 (development)") appers hidden as
PV3 window was moved up. Of course, It only happens when PV is not maximized
(all the times in my case...). Does anyone have the same problem? It seems
that this bar is a bit shy on my computers :o)

Regards

Renato.

ps.: A friend of mine has also complained about the same problem. Another
case of "Title bar timidity"...

Sounds like that bug that was in Qt for Windows.
It was fixed in Qt version 4.2.3.

Message-ID: <7eafad620709120300o4d6de80dh6bdbe3cfc6715d96@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

For what's going to be a fairly big project, I was looking for a good
visualization solution. ParaView looks very promising, but I'd really
like to use it from Python. Since our applications are already moving
to Python 2.5 and the compiled Python bindings seem to require 2.4, I
was wondering if Python 2.5 was supported at all. I'm not wary of
compiling ParaView myself, although I don't really have Visual Studo
(and at the moment I'm not ready to purchase it, though I could
certainly get a Dev Express version or whatever they're called at the
moment). I have mingw already installed, but I gather from the wiki
that the ParaView build process doesn't support it. How hard would it
be to get that working?

Thanks for any answers you might be able to give me.

Cheers,

Manuzhai

Message-ID: <d3d4ab920709120908x50ca27c9yd418a7309d4ac460@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I am experimenting with the new Python interface (via pvpython). I am trying
to change the input of a representation. It seems it does not work.
Following code should first show:

   - A "shrinked" sphere - OK,
   - A solid cone - Wrong, "shrinked" cone instead.

I can not redirect the input of the representation but the input of the
shrink filter can be changed. Is this an expected behavior?

The example:

    sphere = pvsm.sources.SphereSource()
    cone = pvsm.sources.ConeSource()
    shrink = pvsm.filters.ShrinkFilter()

    shrink.Input = sphere

    view = pvsm.CreateRenderView()
    rep = pvsm.CreateRepresentation(shrink, view)
    view.ResetCamera()

    for i in range(100):
      view.StillRender()

    shrink.Input = cone
    rep.Input = cone

    for i in range(100):
      view.StillRender()

Any suggestions will be most appreciated. It is crucial for my work to be
able to do the redirection ...

Thanks,
Milan.

Milan,

You cannot change the input to a representation. However, you should be able
to create a new representation and copy properties from the previous one
with Copy() method of Proxy.

I don't know how hard it would be to build paraview with mingw.

Hello everyone,

I'm experimenting with ParaView as a visualization tool for my
simulation.
At the moment I'm stuck at getting particle data into ParaView.
Particle data is given as a CSV file like:

	timestep x-coord y-coord z-coord

Reading this is easily done, but how do I persuade ParaView
to show the resulting vector array as bubbles (glyphs) at the
endpoints of the vectors?

Thanks in advance

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView III - plugins under OSX
Message-ID: <46E825E9.2040700@mcs.anl.gov>



On my OSX machine, I've built client and server plugins for paraview 3.1.0 for my flash data reader, and set PV_PLUGIN_PATH to 
point to their directories.

Even though the plugins both appear in the "Manage Plugins" dialog of paraview, the plugin's "file_description" string does not 
show up in the "Files of type" drop-down menu of the "Open File" panel.

I've included the server xml, and the client xml and qrc files below.


SERVER MANAGER XML FILE (named "UGFlashReader_Server.xml"):
------------------------
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
<ProxyGroup
         name="sources">
<SourceProxy
         name="FlashHDF5Reader"
         class="vtkFlashHDF5UGReader">

<StringVectorProperty
         name="FileName"
         command="SetFileName"
         number_of_elements="1">

</StringVectorProperty>

<StringVectorProperty
         name="PointArrayInfo"
         information_only="1">
   <ArraySelectionInformationHelper attribute_name="Point"/>
</StringVectorProperty>

<StringVectorProperty
         name="PointArrayStatus"
         command="SetPointArrayStatus"
         number_of_elements="0"
         repeat_command="1"
         number_of_elements_per_command="2"
         element_types="2 0"
         information_property="PointArrayInfo">
   <ArraySelectionDomain
     name="array_list">

       <Property
         name="PointArrayInfo"
         function="ArrayList"/>
     </RequiredProperties>
   </ArraySelectionDomain>
</StringVectorProperty>

</SourceProxy>
</ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>


CLIENT XML FILE (named "UGFlashReader_Client.xml"):
----------------
<ParaViewReaders>
   <Reader name="FlashHDF5Reader"
     extensions=""
     file_description="HDF5 & NetCDF Unstructured Grid Flash PARAMESH files">
   </Reader>
</ParaViewReaders>


CLIENT QRC FILE (named "UGFlashReader_Client.qrc"):
----------------
<RCC>
   <qresource prefix="/Users/hudson/Software/ParaView/ParaView.3.1.0/UGFlashReader_ClientPlugin" >
     <file>UGFlashReader_Client.xml</file>
   </qresource>

I had it that way, but changed it to avoid this error:
Failed to load  ":/ParaViewResources/UGFlashReader_Client.xml"
Failed to load  ":/ParaViewResources/UGFlashReader_Client.xml"
Failed to load  ":/ParaViewResources/UGFlashReader_Client.xml"
Failed to load  ":/ParaViewResources/UGFlashReader_Client.xml"

I don't get that error when it's set to "/Users/hudson/Software/ParaView/ParaView.3.1.0/UGFlashReader_ClientPlugin".

BTW, PV_PLUGIN_PATH is set to 
"/Users/hudson/Software/ParaView/ParaView.3.1.0/UGFlashReader_ClientPlugin:/Users/hudson/Software/ParaView/ParaView.3.1.0/UGFlashReader_ServerPlugin", 
and it's exported.

Well at least its trying to read it with the correct prefix :).
The error message could be clearer, but the xml parser is choking on your "&" 
character.

Sheesh.  I guess I should've caught that.

I would suggest to convert your csv file to the appropriate VTK file format,
ie a PolyData dataset (AFAIK, csv format can't be loaded directly in 
paraview; I have no paraview at my fingertips)

Thus, you have only to load the VTK file in paraview
and use glyph as filter.

BTW, it should be straightforward to convert your csv format to a VTK 
file format
using python for instance.

HTH.

ParaView does build with mingw, though there is no dashboard to make sure it 
stays that way.

This is mainly a versioning issue. The new Xdmf format (Xdmf 2) is not
backwards compatible. We will be focusing on this in the near future.
We should probably provide a converter.

I don't think there but it would be easy to add. I'd recommend putting
a feature request in the bug tracker for it.

Message-ID: <281EABFE-B66D-4282-ADE5-98758928A794@elemtech.com>

I have some DEM data and I am attempting to extract the ridgelines  
from the data.    I'm looking at watershed type information so for my  
definition the ridgeline is location where water flows in different  
locations from the top of an elevated region.  The gradients are a  
clue but I don't know how to create a polyline that traverses the  
ridge.   Does anyone have any suggestions for a good way to do this?

   Thanks,
        Karl

While loading up multiple timesteps of data and then looping through the
timesteps with geometry cached, should I not be able to rotate/translate
the geometry?      Currently, while I have the loop playing, I don't
seem to be able to move the geometry.

ParaView 2 had the ability to rotate during an animation (the animation
would pause during the interaction).  This feature was lost in the
translation to ParaView 3, but you can still pause the animation, do the
rotation/translation, and then play it again.  Your geometry cache will
still be valid.

Hi Robert,

do you have a small hint, how I can run it ... my attempts
did not work!?

Hi Robert,

one more python-using question. I get using your python dump:

>>> Dump.allToPython("test.py")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unbound method allToPython() must be called with
Dump instance as first argument (got str instance instead)

obviously I have to add a Dump instance, but what is that? I
am using pv3.1
Regards!
Fabian

The easiest way would probably be to stuff your data into VTK Legacy
File format.  You can get information about that format from the VTK
User's Guide or in the following link.

Subject: [Paraview] MultiGroup Dataset and Pick Filter
Message-ID: <1BB238BD-D29E-48A2-BE0A-680426046A7E@gmail.com>

I have a multiGroup data set that consists of 2 Unstructured grids.  
The first Group is the data and the second group is basically a  
bounding box. This is a time based data set of which I have written a  
custom reader module. The problem that I am facing is that after I  
load the data set then use the "Extract Dataset" to extract the real  
data I no longer have access to the "Pick" filter. If I load up an  
older "UnstructuredGrid" data set then I have access to the "Pick"  
filter.

The various things that I have tried are: Use the "DataAnalysis  
(Probe/Pick)" but the just crashes ParaView. I tried using the  
"Convert to Simple Dataset" and that also crashed ParaView. I tried  
"Convert to cell Data" and Convert to Point Data. I tried Extract  
Surface, Extract Edges. Both worked but didn't get me any closer.

I guess I could just write my own filter to extract the first group  
and explicitly return an UnstructuredGrid but that seems a bit like  
over kill.

This is on ParaView 2.6.1 on Both OS X 10.4.10 and Windows XP  
(VS2003.net).

Any Advice is greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <BA802EA2-3E10-40A9-8EE4-282A972D79A2@gmail.com>

On Mac OS X, what are the magic settings to get ParaView 3.1.0 (3-1-0  
Branch) to compile?

What version of cmake?
What version of Qt (4.2.3) as frameworks or Dylibs?

I ask because of this error:

Linking CXX shared library ../../bin/libpqWidgets.dylib
ld: Undefined symbols:
_HIViewGetWindow
_HIViewSetNeedsDisplay
_HIWindowFlush
/usr/bin/libtool: internal link edit command failed
make[2]: *** [bin/libpqWidgets.dylib] Error 1
make[1]: *** [Qt/Widgets/CMakeFiles/pqWidgets.dir/all] Error 2

Doing a verbose make it looks like the standard Apple frameworks are  
missing from the link command.

I use cmake 2.4.6 and Qt 4.2.3 that I compiled and installed myself
(with frameworks but I also tested without frameworks in the past).

I have the same setup but still get the error below.. I thought there  
was a bug either in Cmake or ParaView 3 where the Carbon framework  
was not being added to the linker?

  I am now trying on cmake 2.4.7 and ParaView 3 from CVS HEAD as of  
this morning.

Subject: [Paraview] How to set suitable stereo parameters
Message-ID: <200709182228510934602@163.com>

Hi, all

I have  built a polarized passive stereo display system based on one computer equiped with two projectors. It works well in side-by-side mode stereo. Recently I installed paraview as one application on it with some modificaiton made paraview to support side-by-side stereo. The modification is very simple : just split the viewport into two parts and show the left-eye image and right-eye image side-by-side. Although it works, its stereo effect is not good, especial when scaling objects. I wish an effect like flying over the objects, so is it necessary to set the stereo parameters on flying?

I read the codes calculating stereo pair in paraview.  Its major part is in the function 

void vtkPerspectiveTransform::Shear(double dxdz, double dydz, double zplane)

I think this is a toe-in stereo pair generating model, which is not quite good, is it so?

Yes. Here is the configure arguments that I use.

./configure -release -shared -fast -exceptions -stl -no-qt3support - 
prefix /Users/Shared/Toolkits/Qt-4.2.3-Fwrk

This is on OS X 10.4.10 (intel) using Xcode 2.4.1 tool chain.

Mike,

I used ccmake version 2.4-patch 7 and Qt 4.2.3.

Check screen shots of my CMake parameters at

Though I last built w/ BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON, I first built it w/ OFF.

For python2.5 I have to wait, as I just read ... but the
settings for the path would be intersting anyways!?

Are there a modest few changes I can make to resuscitate the reader, or will I have to rewrite it?

Is there a mechanism in place that would allow me to add some meta

vtkDataObjects have a generic vtkInformation * that you can access.
Alternatively you could store information in the Field data arrays.

Isn't that an inherent property of C++? Define

    class myUnstructuredGrid : public vtkUnstructuredGrid
    {
       int myNewData;
    }

then pass pointers to myUnstructuredGrid wherever pointers to 
vtkUnstructuredGrid are needed.

I had thought about that but I was not sure how paraview would react  
to having MyUnstructuredGrid returned instead of vtkUnstructuredGrid.  
I know what _should_ happen assuming kitware abstracted everything  
correctly.. just didn't want any surprises.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with distributed (volume) rendering
Message-ID: <46F0DA0A.5050702@science.uva.nl>

Hello,
(warning, long post :-/)

I'm trying to get distributed volume rendering to work with paraview and 
I'm having some problems. I'm pretty new to paraview (although I've been 
using VTK for some time now) and could use a pointer or 2.

Is it at all possible to use the client-server feature to use a compute 
cluster to do volume rendering with paraview? I seem to find some 
conflicting statements about this on the web.
I'm using the CVS version of paraview (mostly because that's what I do 
with VTK and that works fine). Would that hurt in this case, should I 
use the latest stable 3.0.x?

I've got the following setup:
- one desktop machine (running fedora core 4), on which I run paraview 
as client
- a cluster of machines (running some other linux distribution) on which 
I run pvserver
- connection is reverse from server to client, as there is a firewall in 
between. I've verified the connection can be established.

The following steps work as expected:
1. start paraview on my desktop machine
2. use File -> Connect to let paraview wait for a connection from the 
cluster
3. on the first cluster node run
mpirun -np 8 pvserver -rc -ch=<desktop-machine>
4. the connection is succesfully made
5. load in data with File -> Open, in this case a 128^3 structured 
points set stored in a .vtk file on the cluster nodes (from shared 
homedir available on all cluster nodes)

I actually test with a contour filter a.t.m. as volume rendering gives 
an even greater mess than described below.

The following does not work correctly:
6. add a contour filter, with some appropriate iso-value (Filter -> 
Common -> Contour, Apply).  I'm now seeing a black square, roughly where 
the dataset would be (perhaps the screen-space bounding box?) Sometimes 
the view is updated and I now see a mess: 8 axes that are not aligned 
and parts of the isosurface, but it looks like it's one part of the 
whole isosurface that is repeatedly rendered, but at differing 
locations. It does not look like the whole isosurface is broken into 
pieces that are rendered at the wrong position.

I've set the Remote Render Threshold to 0 to always force remote 
rendering (the option is checked as well).
When I use only 1 cluster node (mpirun -np 1 ...) everything seems to 
work fine, both isosurface and volume rendering.

One thing I suspect is that there's a problem with my MPI installation. 
As I was having problems compiling paraview with MPI support (extra 
libraries not linked in) I set CMAKE_C_COMPILER and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER 
to mpicc and mpic++, respectively. Can this cause problems like this? 
Second thing is that I'm having trouble confirming which implementations 
of MPI there are on my workstation and cluster machines. A mismatch here 
will probably also cause trouble. A final thing I was wondering about is 
wether the client <-> server connection is also using MPI, or if it uses 
some proprietary form of communication?

Thanks for any help,
Paul

>From your description, it sounds like the server is not opening
rendering contexts correctly.  More specifically, it sounds like two or
more processes on the server are opening rendering windows that are on
top of each other.  Check to make sure that the DISPLAY environment
variable for each process is set to localhost:0 and that each process
has its own GPU.  If you don't have GPUs in your cluster, you can just
use OSMesa to get around the problem.

See the Wiki for more details.

Also, if you plan to do volume rendering, I recommend sticking with the
CVS version.  There are some known issues with parallel volume rendering
in 3.0.

Hello,

I'm trying to use Paraview as visualization solution for my simulation.
I would like to use a custom data format (at least until I'm familiar  
with Paraview).
Essential this format gives me blocks of raw binary data of floats   
(LittleEndian, 32Bit).
So, VTK-Legacy files are not an option.
Is there a way to fit this blocks into the VTK-XML files, without  
encoding or
compressing it?
As stated in the file-formats.pdf there should be a way to disable  
both features,
but how does this work?

Cheers

ParaView has a "Raw (binary) Files" reader that will read in 2 and 3
dimensional arrays from files.  Is that what you are looking for?

Partially, yes. But I have a parallel application, so using this  
reader is
complicated and akward.
Each block holds n*n*(n+Ghostcells) values and is located in a 3D grid.
If there is a way to automate the process of reading the blocks, the  
metadata
and putting the domains together via python scripting the RAW reader,
I have no idea how to do this.
Help in this matter would be nice, also.

Message-ID: <48095565B5FB48378B8FA32D93A3C85A@nacad.ufrj.br>


A friend brought me a question about a rendering problem in ParaView. He
created a very simple dataset in VTK legacy format (available in
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/Celula_reservatorio.vtk) and
loaded the data in PV (versions 2.6.2 and 3.1.0) without any problem but,
when he tries to move and rotate the geometry it turns completely distorted
and messed (as can be seen here
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/Celula_paraview2.JPG and here
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/Celula_paraview.JPG). My first
thought was that it could be a driver problem so I tried to reproduced the
same problem in my computer which showed me the same problematic geometry
(only when I move and rotate the model). If you look into the data supplied
you can see that the point coordinates are a bit large, here is another
suspicious... __Maybe__ VTK or PV is getting a confused about so large point
coordinates. Does anyone have any idea about what is happening?

Thanks for any help

Same problem Berk :-(

I changed the file and the problem seems to keep happening...
(http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/rendering-problem.JPG) 

Note:  I have not checked the file since I'm not familiar with VTK format. I
just thought it was right since PV has not complained about anything and
(seemingly) loaded the data correctly. Furthermore, the problem only occur
when the model is moved inside PV.

Please keep correspondance on the list so that 1) others can benefit from our 
brilliant insights :) and 2) others can correct our stupid mistakes.

You almost have it right - the VTK XML file documentation is missing two 
important details. First, change your line to

    <AppendedData encoding="raw">

Section, start each section of raw data with a 4-byte integer giving the number 
of bytes in that section. In your case there is just one such section.

By the way your grid is not "rectilinear".

Almost there!

I could finally reproduce it. I had to zoom further than I tried
before. It seems to be a bug/inaccuracy in the calculation of the
clipping planes due to the large numbers in point coordinate. I
created a bug report (#5753). We will look at this this in the future.

Hi Shigenobu ,

No, because ParaView 2.6 does not allow you to specify a color space 
("Blackbody Radiation" uses the CIELab color space.) or to set colors at 
scalar values other than the endpoints of the scalar range. Both of 
these are new features in ParaView 3.

Hi all,
A friend who studied  micro-channel with FLUENT had also some rendering 
problem with small geometry   (10^(-6) m)
Most of people who are not familiar with the numerical world and 
programming, doesn't normalised (with non dimension) their data with a 
characteristc length or velocity or time, etc...
They use small or big values and then, they are surprised to see some bugs.
They forgot that their value are used by a processor which only read 
binary with finite extension ...

Maybe, Paraview should use double precision (or more...lol) for this 
type of users.

St?ph

VTK actually uses double precision for this sort of stuff. However, a
lot of times the point coordinates come in as float. Also, there may
be some intermediate variables that we missed in the float -> double
conversion. Also, OpenGL uses float not double :-) It is a difficult
problem...

Hello

Do you know if it is possible to calculate surface area of a 3D object in paraview.
I know it is possible in VolView but I do not know how to do it in Paraview.

Thanks in advance

Well, I can't say nothing about it since the data that this friend was
trying to visualize comes from another software used in geological basin
modelling which processes huge amount of data that comes from seismic
analysis. Conclusion: huge quantities are common for geologists and the
softwares that they are used to.

Ahh, that would be SELinux denying access to the shared library.  You 
should be able to fix it with 'chcon'.  Go to your lib/paraview-3.0 
directory and do the following:

chcon -t texrel_shlib_t libavutil.so.49

You may have to repeat this for every shared library in the directory, 
e.g., *.so.*

Hi Randy,

You should restructure your code a little. You should not be setting
the output directly. Instead you should probably shallow copy the
internal data object (aVTKUGSetup I think) to the output created by
the superclass. You can look at any subclass of
vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm in the Graphics directory to see how to
get the output. To fully experience the new pipeline, you can also use
RequestData() and RequestInformation() as most new algorithms now do.
I believe one of the newsletters talk about the new pipeline

Thanks, reading single files does work now.
The next step would be reading distributed data. Which looks simple
using the .pvti format.
My XML file now looks like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="PImageData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
	<PImageData WholeExtent="0 257 0 255 0 255"  Origin="0 0 0"  
Spacing="1 1 1">
		<Piece Extent="0 257 0 255 0 63" Source="process0/out.vti"/>
		<Piece Extent="0 257 0 255 64 127" Source="process1/out.vti"/>
		<Piece Extent="0 257 0 255 128 191" Source="process2/out.vti"/>
		<Piece Extent="0 257 0 255 192 255" Source="process3/out.vti"/>
	</PImageData>
</VTKFile>

But on reading this Paraview complains about missing data between the  
blocks
(namely 63-64, 127-128 and 191-192).
How can I solve this?

I've not worked with that particular format but I think the files must share 
the vertexes at their shared border so that all cells are defined:

Hi,
me again.
I just read the python user guide from the wiki and found
the explanation, how to adjust the PYTHONPATH, but
with my binary installation of 3.0 or 3.1 there are no such
files!? Is it the problem of the binaries?
Due to those missing files, I obviously have trouble load
the needed modules, e.g. 'from paraview import servermanager':

node1~$ pvpython
Python 2.5 (release25-maint, Dec  9 2006, 14:12:17)
[GCC 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-20)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more
information.
>>> from paraview import servermanager
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name servermanager

Is there a way to get it running with a precompiled paraview
version? I have some trouble to compile paraview from
source, due to the missing qt4 libraries on my redhat 4.3
system...

Regards!
Fabian

The server manager module was developed after the 3.0/3.1 release. Hence 
it's only available in the CVS version.

Subject: [Paraview] pv3 - server always shows 100% cpu usage
Message-ID: <46F3A3D2.9010402@cscs.ch>

When running pv3 (pvserver), utilities like top and any other system 
monitoring tools always show 100% (or at least whenever I look at them) 
cpu usage - even when nothing is going on and the server should have 
been idle for hours. I suspect something fishy is going on at the 
server-client connection and the server is constantly polling to see if 
any new messages are ready.

Can anyone confirm/deny or explain if there is a 'problem' - is this a 
design feature?

thanks

JB

That was a golden insight! It turned out that X11 forwarding was turned 
on for the connections from the render nodes, so they all effectively 
rendered on the first node.
It works fine now.

Funny.  I get the opposite effect.  The root node of my server is pretty
much idle whereas all the others are at 100%.

I am absolutely positive this is just an artifact of the implementation
of the underlying socket and MPI libraries, respectively.  I attached a
debugger to a server and verified that while the server is "idle," node
0 is waiting for the select function to finish and all other nodes are
waiting for the MPI_Recv function to finish.  I placed breakpoints right
after these functions and saw that they never returned until after I did
something with the client.

Perhaps we should move the Cache Geometry (and Cache Limit) settings to
the Application Settings dialog.  This would implicitly mean that the
value would be saved and would also mean that we could get rid of the
Animation Inspector, which the Animation View has pretty much made
obsolete.

Is there any way to save the "cache geometry" value as a default so that
each session this value is automatically toggled on/off.   It appears to
be turned off for every new session, despite the fact that I checked the
box in the previous session.   Paraview seems to keep a lot of other
values from session to session.

Subject: [Paraview] creating animation time problem
Message-ID: <245426.96802.qm@web38309.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,
  I've successfully created an animation using paraview, 
  I have 20 files which I load into the timestep and make 20 key frames with each file respectively.  I can alter the real time duration and play the animation great in paraview.
   
  My problem is when I save the animation it turns out to be 3 seconds.  I have tried altering real time duration, increasing frames in sequence duration, adding more key frames, nothing seems to affect the saved animations time.  It appears to me that is just runs through each time frame and that's it.  
  Any idea on how I can save my animation so it plays slower?

I found the binaries on the paraview web site ( thank you for preparing those).

I untarred the into place (/usr/local/paraview-3.1.0 ).
When I start up paraview or when I run help from in site paraview I get the
following warning ....

/usr/lib64/libpng12.so.0: no version information available (required by
/usr/local/paraview-3.1.0-Linux-x86/lib/paraview-3.1/libQtGui.so.4)

/usr/lib64/libpng12.so.0 points actually to /usr/lib64/libpng12.so.0.1.2.7
So a version number should be available .

Will this give a problem down the line ?


I am running Redhat 4 x86/64

Thank you.

After using the "Save View Image" in PV 261 (custom built) the render  
window is basically blank. By that I mean, the background color is  
there but the visualization of my data is missing and nothing I do  
seems to be able to bring it back. Is this a known bug or does anyone

Wow, that was fast.  I just made that page Friday.

The tutorial will not happen until mid November.  Thus, I am still
compiling all of the material.  Right now the page is just a placeholder
for the data so that I can verify that the links are valid in the other

Setting the Animation Duration and Frame Rate in the Animation Settings
Dialog (that you get after you select Save Animation) works for me.  Can
you give more details?  What version of ParaView are you using?  On what
platform?  Did you build it yourself or did you download binaries?

Apologies, I only saw later that SC07 still has to happen!  Good luck

These libraries also have a version number built inside the file (or maybe 
you're missing that), and I think its complaining about that instead of the 
file name.

I don't think it will give you any problems in this case.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.1.0 / "Save Screenshot" error Linux
Message-ID: <46F85D2A.8000700@eos.ubc.ca>

Hello Everybody,

I am new to the list. I compiled Paraview 3.1.0 from source today on my
gentoo linux, since the binaries from the homepage were not able to save
a screenshot. I still get this error upon export:

X Error: GLXBadContext 166
  Extension:    146 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 5 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x402f6d
X Error: GLXBadContext 166
  Extension:    146 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 5 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x40001a
.... (lots more)

Paraview writes to the file, in my case a png, but when I open the png,
only random color lines appear, not the actual screenshot.

Currently Xorg-7.3 is on my System and mesa 6.5.2. It looks like a GLX
bug, but it's the first time I see it and this was when using paraview.

Can anybody help or has experienced this?

Cheers,

Alex

This problem is simple but interesting one.
I am plotting some scalar data over structured grids. The data file is as

In first PointData set I have used Name="Fat ray (s)" and Name="Fat rays
(s)" in second case. When I tried to plot surface of these data pair
separately, to my surprise, I get the constant value(it does not work even
with *rescale to data range*) to  in first case while in second case it
shows the righ result. Data are the same in two cases. I tried with several
other data, but found the similar problem. Is it something the problem in my
operating system or the problem with some key words conflict in paraview
3.1.0? I would be grateful for the suggestions.

Sincerely,

Just wanted to add that I used to get a similar problem all the time 
with pv2.x. After saving a screen shot, the interactors would be 
disabled in effect. It was no longer possible to rotate, pan, etc. I 
didn't get a blank screen, but nothing updated properly afterwards. 
Effectively it make PV unusable once I'd taken a snapshot and had to 
restart (this was linux/windows)

I tried this data set on the two versions of ParaView that I have
available on my Windows XP: ParaView 3.0.2 and the latest CVS snapshot
(of last night).  The behavior looks fine in both places to me.

 

Perhaps this was a temporary problem that happened in the 3.1.0 snapshot
(which is not an official release of ParaView and is known to be buggy).
Could you try with ParaView 3.0.2 to see if that fixes the problem?
Trying a more recent CVS snapshot would be good to if you are
comfortable with checking out and compiling ParaView yourself.

I am plotting some scalar data over structured grids. The data file is
as follow:

 

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="StructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <StructuredGrid WholeExtent="0 1 0 2 0 3"> 
  <Piece Extent="0 1 0 2 0 3">
    <PointData>
      <DataArray type="Int16" Name="Fat ray (s)" format="ascii"
RangeMin="0" RangeMax="6"> 
        0 1 1 2 2 3
        1 2 2 3 3 4
        2 3 3 4 4 5
        3 4 4 5 5 6
      </DataArray>
      <DataArray type="Int16" Name="Fat rays (s)" format="ascii"
RangeMin="0" RangeMax="6"> 
        0 1 1 2 2 3
        1 2 2 3 3 4
        2 3 3 4 4 5
        3 4 4 5 5 6
      </DataArray>
    </PointData>
    <CellData>
    </CellData>
    <Points>
      <DataArray type="Float32" Name="Array 0x85412e8"
NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii" RangeMin="0"
RangeMax="3.7416573868">
        0 0 0 1 0 0
        0 1 0 1 1 0
        0 2 0 1 2 0
        0 0 1 1 0 1
        0 1 1 1 1 1
        0 2 1 1 2 1
        0 0 2 1 0 2
        0 1 2 1 1 2
        0 2 2 1 2 2
        0 0 3 1 0 3
        0 1 3 1 1 3 
        0 2 3 1 2 3
      </DataArray>
    </Points>
  </Piece>
  </StructuredGrid>
</VTKFile>

 

In first PointData set I have used Name="Fat ray (s)" and Name="Fat rays
(s)" in second case. When I tried to plot surface of these data pair
separately, to my surprise, I get the constant value(it does not work
even with rescale to data range) to  in first case while in second case
it shows the righ result. Data are the same in two cases. I tried with
several other data, but found the similar problem. Is it something the
problem in my operating system or the problem with some key words
conflict in paraview 3.1.0? I would be grateful for the suggestions. 

 

Sincerely,

Hom Nath

The Save Screenshot feature uses a special offscreen buffer to do the
rendering (to prevent capturing any dialog boxes or other windows that
may be over the ParaView window).  This is a tricky bit of code because
different graphics hardware provides different mechanisms for doing
this.

This could be an issue with your graphics driver (we have seen them
before).  If possible, try updating your driver and get back to us.

Message-ID: <20070925160135.10310@gmx.net>

Hi,
Just a quick question on the smoothing in paraview: I suppose that by setting the "convergence" to 0, it is not exactly 0, but something like 1E-6 or so. Is that right? Anybody knows about the precision of that invar?
Thanks for your help

Thanks for the info! Do you know anything about the
approximate release date of 3.2? I am running an 'old'
redhat 4 without qt4...

Subject: [Paraview] creating animation time problem continued
Message-ID: <700313.84847.qm@web38315.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Ok to be more specific i am using paraview version 2.6
  I add the keyframes lets say 10
  I can set the real time duration to lets say 10 seconds and watch the animation play in real time for (10 secs).
  I click save animation, and i have no further options and save the file as an avi file.
  When i go and open the file in media player for instance it plays in 2 seconds.  How can i get the animation i save to play like the real time animation in paraview?

Message-ID: <46FA699C.7030104@pascal-anschau.de>

Hello,

System infos:
openSUSE 10.2, Kernel 2.6.18.2-34-default #1 SMP, 64 bit
Cmake 2.4.5
Qt 4.3.1 (built from source)
gcc 4.1.2
openMPI 1.2.3 (built from source)

when compiling ParaView, I run into the following problem:

------- Snippet ------

My Cmake settings were as follows:

Actually I wanted the BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARIES option OFF, but after each
configure Cmake shows it ON again.

Can anyone give me a hint what is wrong here?

Thanks in advance!

Pascal.

Message-ID: <46FA6B1C.1030301@tp1.rub.de>

Hello,

I would like to read domain decomposed data into ParaView as a single block.
But reading the data from VTKImageData (*.vti) gives me the single
blocks missing
the boundaries (there is a gap between the blocks).
When I use a partioned VTK image data format, ParaView complains about
missing
data at the boundaries ("UpdateExtend cannot be filled").
This problem arises when using ParaView master files (.pvd) or reading
the blocks
individually and appending attributes to obtain a single object.
It seems to be fundamental to the data format, since VisIt reproduces this.
Has anyone experiences with this kind of problem?

Thorsten

ps: I'm using Paraview 3.0.2 on Feodora Core 6 Linux.

Can you increase the "snippet" to include the error message please? 
Alternatively don't do a parallel build i.e. use "make" instead of
"make -j 2" and then make should stop at the error correctly.

I cannot replicate your problem.  Can you give some more details on what
you are doing?

Note that when you apply the clip filter, it also tetrahedralizes your
data and converts it into an unstructured grid.  This can dramatically
increase the memory footprint (possibly by 2 orders of magnitude if the
original data only had one array on it).  If you are applying a clip to
a 3D array of over a million points total, you may simply be running out
of memory.

Note that this is not an issue for the slice filter.

Turning python on forces shared libraries.  I can't remember why, though.

That wiki is for developers only. That's why it doesn't allow you to
create an account. I can do that when I get back to Albany tomorrow.

There was no more error message! I posted the last 6 lines. Anyway, it
is working now. I tried it the not parallel way, but this didn't work
either. In the end I completely removed the source tree and started from
scratch, and it worked. However, I had to put into CMake all possible
openMPI library links, even the ones with .so.0 ending. Seemes a bit
tedious to me... Beside this and the plain "make" I did the same as
before, and it worked well.
The only drawback after installation is, that ParaView can't find lots
of libraries, even if I set LD_LIBRARY_PATH pointing to the right
locations. In the end I just copied all libraries into /usr/local/lib64,
and that works. Not very elegant though...

Thanks anyway for the quick response!

>From recent communication with people at cd-adapco, it seems that they would

However, their implementation would be incompatible with what kitware is
reportedly developing.

There does not seem to be anything yet in the CVS sources ... or should I be
looking for a particular class?

How far along is the development and how the class is to be implemented?

Would it still be worthwhile to include the cd-adapco version as an
intermediate solution and/or as an alternative implementation?

The cd-adapco implementation /might/ have the advantage that it should
likely support non-convex polyhedra. If their implementation somehow fits
into VTK it would seem like a good idea to have it ASAP.
(A bird in the hand ...).

Which means I have to copy the shared sections of data to each of the  
files?
Since I have found no working combination of Ghostlevels, PieceExtent  
and
WholeExtent values, I have tried using .pvd files which leaves the  
"missing"
sections blank. (And crashes ParaView when I use volume rendering on  
the data)
Or is there a solution, which does not rely on copiing data, which I  
would prefer strongly
due to memory restrictions.

There is a possibility that we might be implementing polyhedron
support sometime in the future. Note the use of might, possible etc...
We are not actively working on a polyhedron implementation for VTK.
So, if the lovely folks at cd-adapco are willing to release their
vtkPolyhedron, that would be awesome :-) Theirs will be much better
tested and stable than anything we can do in the near future.

Is this your own build of Qt?  If so, did you "make install" it?
To double check, if you do "echo $QMAKESPEC" that gives you what you 
set, right?
What version of CMake?

I build qt 4.2.3 by my own, could not find any package for
scientific linux (redhat clone) 4.4 and I used an binary
cmake version 2.4.7.  Echoing QMAKESPEC gives:
node1~$ echo $QMAKESPEC

Thanks for your help!

Message-ID: <6bb554800709300949g56bd0b32p500e43393063d0f4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all Paraview users,

I am using Paraview to plot my cfd results. I am using ensight gold binary
format. I can write and read the data with no problem, but it seems paraview
interprets the things wrong.

The geometry file is divided in two part one containing the internal flow
(hexa8, unstructured)  and a part containing the boundary file  (quad4
unstructured elements).

The problem is that always the temperature on the North wall of my geometry
seems to mixed with data from both hexa8 (first elementh near) the wall and
quad4 element (placed on the hexa8 wall). More if i do a cut trough the
geometry and display the temperature the temperature profile is completely
wrong
On the other hand if i use "Extract Datasets" option i can see the correct
Temperature profile on the inner flow and on the boundary area for each part
separately.
In order to check out more the encounterdproblem i decided to export a
simple OpenFOAM 3d case (20*20*20) (the 2d (in one direction only 1 cell)
works with no probblem) and also i noticed strange things. For exporting i
used the included foamToEnsight module.

Last and final try was to check the .case file in ensight8 and none of the
problems mentioned above were noted.


Did anybody else have had such problems ? There is any way around this?

Greetings Adrian,

I use an EnSight Gold format with "parts," unstructured grids, multiple 
element types.

Is Temperature point or cell data for the hex8 elements?

Is Temperature point or cell data for the quad4 elements?

In my experience, each "part" is a separate displayable object. While 
the nodal points appear "unique" to each "part" in the ParaView data 
set, the nodal points have the exact same coordinates since the quad4 
are overlaying the hex8 surface (at least, in my data sets they would).

With quad4's overlaying the hex8 surface being coincident, I think you 
may seeing a visual competition between the display from each part?

Hi Samuel

Thanks a lot for your answer.

Both hex8 and quad4 store temperature as cell data. You are right the quad4
elements
are overlaying the hex8 surface.

If there is only a visual competition between the display from each part I
think that should not effect the inner flow far from the wall no ?

For you all this works without problem ?

All the best
Adrian
