Hello ParaView users !

I'd like to make my own application derived from vtkKWApplication class.
But I can't find any documentation about KWWidgets and KWCommon class set.
I'm trying to explore ParaView source code, but it's very large 
application for beginer.

Would you like give my any suggestions ?

Hi
I put ParaView aside for a while, waiting for an answer but no answer 
came and I'm still facing the same problem...
Could anybody answer me please.

Hi,
I'm trying to add a new VTK source for ParaView. I found the XML files
describing user sources and I see them appear in ParaView menus when
modifying the XML.

The first problem is that I can't find any documentation on the XML and
it's DTD. And the second one is that I don't know where to put my
compiled VTK class and how to relate it with the XML description.

If somebody could give me an example or point me to a documentation it
would be great.

Thanks

Michael.

Hi Michael,

The reason we have not provided any documentation nor a DTD for 
the XML used in ParaView is that it is still changing rapidly
and that we did not want to tie ourselves to anything before
we have something we believe is final. Having said that, I can
give you some pointers:

1. When ParaView starts, it looks in a directory pointed by
the PV_INTERFACE_PATH env. variable and tries to load all
.xml files there.

2. If you compiled your own sources and filters into a separate
library, you have to tell ParaView to load it in the XML. NOTE:
You need to generate the TCL wrapped library as well. Here is
how to do it:

<ModuleInterfaces>
  <Library name="vtkMyLibraryTCL"/>
  <!-- interface description for the modules goes here-->
</ModuleInterfaces>

You also have to setup your TCLLIBPATH and PATH to include
where the library is.

3. Look at ParaView/vtkPVDefaultModules.h to see how the
modules in ParaView are done. It is a little hard to read
but should contain all the information you need. 

4. Keep in mind that the XML can change and you might end up
having to update your XML files in future.

Let me know if you any questions.

Hi,

I found an old bug in ParaView and I just verify in the last nightly 
version, it is still here. I hope this is the right place for bug report...
On unix system (tested on linux) if you run ParaView without an absolute 
path (so ParaView is in the system path) there is a segmentation fault 
when you try to play the demo:

This problem is due to an error in the file 
"KWCommon/vtkKWDirectoryUtilities.cxx" in the method "GetSystemPath" 
(line 270 today):

the original line :
    if ((length > 0) && (path[length-1] != pathSep[0]))
must be change in
    if ((length > 0) && (pathEnv[length-1] != pathSep[0]))

Hi,

I ran into some problems using ParaView with MPI (mpich version 1.2.5 on
a linux biprocessor).

Running ParaView-MPI binaries (mpirun -np 2 ParaView-MPI) and using the
Mandelbrot source (or glyphing filter on a sphere with high theta and 
phi resolution values), a new vtk renderer window appears and renders 
part of the display; if this window is somehow hidden, the display in 
the main window is buggy or incomplete (I can send screenshots if needed).

Running ParaView-MPI with -np 3, -np 4... I got 2, 3 additionnal windows.

I then compiled a CVS version of ParaView in order to see if this
problem was specific to PV-06 binaries, but this time, the additionnal
windows appear directly at launch time (Might I have gone wrong in
specifying MPI compilation options ?). Rendering and display present the
same problems, and I get this error message :
Process id: 1 >> ERROR: In
/home/cea2002/een/Sources/2003-02-21/VTK/Rendering/vtkInteractorStyle.cxx,
line 387

Does someone know anything about these problems ?

Hi Berk,

sounds like you know how to activate Paraview's stereoscopic view on a 
single CPU...  :-)))  That is EXACTLY what I'm trying to achieve! As to 
my current status: with some help from Giancarlo Amati I have succeeded 
in generating stereoscopic images using vtk/tcl. So, how do I get these 
few lines of code into Paraview? And PLEASE tell me, it's simple (I am 
not excactly what you'd call a crack)... Thanks a lot in advance!

This is expected. Unless off-screen rendering is enabled, ParaView will
create a new render window on each process. These windows should not be
covered by other windows in any way, otherwise, the parallel image 
compositing will not work. This is because the image buffer is
grabbed during compositing. There are a few ways of avoiding this:

1. send each window to a different display; this is the common way
of running paraview on a cluster

2a. On Unix/Linux, compile paraview with mesa or a combination of 
another GL and mangled Mesa and use off-screen rendering
2b. On Windows, use off-screen rendering 
To enable off-screen rendering, you have to define the PV_OFFSCREEN
env. variable. Note that this will only work with the Windows binaries,
on Unix/Linux, you have to recompile VTK and ParaView. I can point
you to some documentation if this is what you want.

You can ignore this message. It is harmless. We will fix it in the
near future (it might have already been fixed). Also, the CVS version of
ParaView is not very stable at the moment since there are a lot of
changes going on.

I just tried to do it this way (started two X servers and arranged for 
each window to have its own), but (still using the mandelbrot source) I 
just got black renderer windows. When I interact with the scene, it 
appears, but as soon as I release it an it gets fully rendered the 
display area goes black...

There is a method called CreateRenderObjects() in vtkPVRenderView.
This is where all the rendering objects (render window and renderer)
are created. To enabled stereoscopic for a single processor, All you
need to do (in theory) is to add the appropriate calls in that
function. Right after the new render window is created for example.

The threshold in ParaView extracts cells (in this case voxels)
which contain values in the given range. I don't think it will be 
able to  do what you are interested in doign. I recommend looking at 
itk for segmentation (www.itk.org). Once you perform the segmentation
in itk, you should be able to display the result in ParaView.

Hmmm. Something must be going wrong in the compositing. Does changing
any of the "Parallel rendering parameters" in Genera Setting make
any difference ?

I recently posted the following messages to the VTK mailing list:

About GL and mangled Mesa:

You can not. You have to use mangled mesa which allows you to
link against both nvidia's GL and mesa. You then create
different rendering objects when you want to use the mesa
off-screen. Look at
VTK/Examples/MangledMesa/README.txt
and the examples
in VTK/Examples/MangledMesa/Tcl

About compiling Mesa mangled:

Here is how I do it:

1. use  Makefile.X11 to build Mesa (not configure)
2. edit Make-config, add -DUSE_MGL_NAMESPACE to CFLAGS of the target
linux-static 
3. compile the target linux-static
4. rename libGL.a to something like libMGL.a
5. follow the instruction in VTK/Examples/MangledMesa/README.txt

Some of the later versions of Mesa might not compile since the mangled
stuff was broken for a while. I usually use Mesa 4 (cvs should also
work).

Emmanuel,

Another option is to slide the collection threshold (on view parameters 
page) up.  This will cause even large files to be collected to node zero 
for local rendering.
(This is why you do not see the extra window until you create something 
"large".)

You would loose the parallel rendering, but processing would still execute 
in parallel.

Charles.

Hi,

Berk, actually my plan was to avoid recompiling the (Win) version of 
Paraview which I usually have problems with... ;-)   Anyway, thanks for 
your advice! In the meantime (and thanks to Charles) I have succeeded 
in using Paraview to produce stereoscopic images. :-))  So just in case 
somebody else has a similar problem: The trick is to enter the 
following commands

RenWin1 StereoCapableWindowOn
RenWin1 SetStereoTypeToInterlaced (or SetStereoTypeToRedBlue, or ...)
RenWin1 StereoRenderOn

either directly into the command box ("window" menu) or via load 
session from a *.pvs file. While Paraview complains that the stereo 
option needs to be specified prior to displaying a rendering object it 
still complies.

Thanks again, folks!

Georg

It doesn't seem to. By the way there seems to be a small bug with the 
"Parallel rendering parameters" push buttons : clicking on the 
"Composite with floats" button, I got the "Composite RGBA" button pushed 
as well.

I tried the same two X servers business on another (more up to date) 
system, and got separate rendering windows to display correctly, but 
compositing didn't work.
Seems like compositing doesn't support working with both :0 and :1 
display on the same computer. It does work nonetheless, when I use two 
computers with display :0, like you suggested.

Thanks for your advice, an thanks to Charles for the great "collection 
treshold" tip.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Load File problems
Message-ID: <3E8024C0.E40BB4AE@cscs.ch>

Hello

I have several problems listing files in the "Open Data" menu on my
Linux box.

1) The browser does not see files which do not have write permission. I
usually try to make input data files read-only to prevent accidental
overwrites. ParaView does not see them, if I select their specific file
extension, or if I select All Files *.*

2) While using the "Up one level" arrow, I cannot go all the way up to
the root directory, i.e. /
No files or directories are visible, which means I cannot go to
different disks.

Has anyone seen this? I use last night's CVS version, although I have
had this problem for a while now.

Thanks for the help.

We have been developing an alternative file browser that can browse files 
on the server when ParaView is running in client server mode.  It is 
currently under development, and we will try fix the bugs you are reporting.

This file browser is the currently (during development) the default, but it 
will only be used with the client-server option in the future.

Charles.

Hi everyone,

There is vtk file which is generated by Marching Cubes. Then I want to

example to illustrate it. Could you write an example script to show how to 
do this function?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <200303100811.h2A8B5W28535@gocre.ocre.cea.fr>

	Hi,

	I want to know why in the "Advanced Reader" MMI there is obligatorily the 
field "FileName". Indeed, if we change the source file name the MMI becomes 
wrong. For example I put in "standardReader.XML" an "ArraySelection" tag, so 
the reader builds a menu with the name of all the arrays in the file. But if 
i change the path to select a new file, the arrays menu is not update. 

So my question is: how can I remove the field "FileName" ?
