Subject: [Paraview] Fw: Problems compiling and using the CVS
Message-ID: <005801c387f1$ce456bb0$d703e482@netgl>


 Hi I'm trying to build ParaView using VS7 and I'm using the
 BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON. I have compiled ParaView before succsesfully but
after
a recent CVS update I get the following problems
While Building H5detect. This does not prevent ParaView from beeing built
 succesfully.
 Compiling...
 H5detect.c
 c:\kitware\ParaView\Utilities\hdf5\H5private.h(212) : warning C4117: macro
 name '__FUNCTION__' is reserved, '#define' ignored
 --The same waring turns up alot when the vtkhdf5 is built

 My other problem is when I try to run ParaView I get the following error
 preventing ParaView from running:

 ERROR: In \kitware\ParaView\Widgets\vtkKWApplication.cxx, line 399
 vtkPVApplication (0A7248F8):
   Script:
 vtkPVGeometryFilter Geometry1
   Returned Error on line 1:
 invalid command name "vtkPVGeometryFilter"

 I can load the vtkKWParaViewTCL.dll manualy using the command "load
 vtkKWParaViewTCL.dll" but the vtkPVGeometryFilter does not load->
 The vtkPVGeometryFilter does not seem to come through the cvs update and
 when I download it manually+ the remainig vtkCTH...
 I get a ParaView only showing bounding boxes.
 I have done a couple of different CVS updats but nothing seems to work.
 So my question is: how can I get a working source for ParaView newer than
 the 06 version?


 I hope you can help me.
 Best regards Ulfar Fridjonsson

Did you try the 1.0.2 alpha from the ParaView web page? You can
either get the binary or get the source and compile it yourself.

Hello Ulfar Fridjonsson,

vtkPVGeometryFilter was moved from VTK to ParaView, but this change
should not cause any problems.

For a more stable version of ParaView you can update the release version using

cvs update -r ParaView-1-0

Charles.

You've exported the DISPLAY environment for the current process, but not
for the other processes that mpirun starts. You need to "export
DISPLAY=:0.0" in your .login, or use the ch_mpd device (I assume you're
using ch_p4) and add "-MPDENV- DISPLAY=:0.0" to the end of the mpirun
command.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20031003110307.00bdfea0@mail.ncsa.uiuc.edu>

Hello,

I have a question about writing a new reader for paraview. Can I just write 
the reader as if it
were just for VTK and have it work with paraview or is there some special 
paraview class I
must inherit from? When running paraview in parallel does it use the same 
pipeline parallelism
mode as the paralleliso example? I have heard there is a guide of sorts 
under development.
Would there be a developers section somewhere? I would appreciate having a 
look at even a
alpha version of such a doc.

Regards,
Dave

Hi Dave,

ParaView uses standard VTK readers. You have to make sure to modify
ParaVew/Resources/Readers.xml file.

There is no document yet, not even an alpha. Sorry. ParaView can use
any reader that can be created in Tcl as long as it's interface
meets certain requirements:

1. GetOutput(int n) - must return a subclass of vtkDataSet
2. Set/Get pair for each property to be set from the user interface
3. If you want to allow array selection, you also need the following:

  // Get the data array selection tables used to configure which data
  // arrays are loaded by the reader.
  vtkGetObjectMacro(PointDataArraySelection, vtkDataArraySelection);
  vtkGetObjectMacro(CellDataArraySelection, vtkDataArraySelection);
  
  // Description:  
  // Get the number of point or cell arrays available in the input.
  int GetNumberOfPointArrays();
  int GetNumberOfCellArrays();
  
  // Description:
  // Get the name of the point or cell array with the given index in
  // the input.
  const char* GetPointArrayName(int index);
  const char* GetCellArrayName(int index);
  
  // Description:
  // Get/Set whether the point or cell array with the given name is to
  // be read.
  int GetPointArrayStatus(const char* name);
  int GetCellArrayStatus(const char* name);
  void SetPointArrayStatus(const char* name, int status);  
  void SetCellArrayStatus(const char* name, int status); 

4. Parallel readers should work properly in data parallel mode; i.e
they need to set the WholeExtent or the MaximumNumberOfPieces in
ExecuteInformation() and fill in the right Extent or Piece in Execute()
If you need a controller, you can get it with vtkMultiProcessController::GetGlobalController()

I have described how to add the reader with an xml file in a previous
e-mail: http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2003-September/000290.html

Hi,

I create a jpeg image using the paraview GUI with Glyphs at unstructured 
grid points.  I then write out the batch script file for the same process.  
When i run paraview --batch on the resulting batch-script i don't get the 
same image back (the glyphs don't show up properly).  Is there something 
in the batch file that needs to be modified?

thanks,

Could you reproduce this on a small example and send us trace file?
What version of ParaView are you using?

Thank you.

Thanks Berk for the detailled mail. Yet, I wonder if you could add one 
more detail.

I have a multi-block reader, which produces 120 StructuredGrids (120 for 
the particular dataset). The Tcl version of the reader works very well 
with VTK, I am able to Append all geometries and display the full 
domain, without any warnings, etc..

Here is a code segment:

vtkTECPLOTReader reader
   reader SetFileName cyl.dat
   reader Udpate

vtkAppendPolyData append

for {set i 0} { $i < 120} { incr i} {
   vtkGeomFilter geo$i
   geo$i SetInput [reader GetOutput $i]
   append AddInput [geo$i GetOutput]
}

Mapper + Actor and voila

The same reader in ParaView only shows the first block, i.e. [reader 
GetOutput 0].

What is missing? I suspect that one more requirement to add to Berk's 
list is that the reader should be able to return its number of Outputs 
early on. Exactly when is my question. During ExecuteInformation?

Thanks for any tip.

Jean

Jean,

It sounds like your reader is not setting the number of outputs.  Try:

reader GetNumberOfOutputs

If it returns 1, then ParaView thinks there is only one output and shows 
only one block.

Charles.

Actually, in the current implementation:
1. If using a ReaderModule, GetNumberOfOutputs() has to return the
correct number even before ExecuteInformation() is called
2. If using AdvancedReaderModule, GetNumberOfOutputs() has to return the
correct number after ExecuteInformation() is called

I am changing this behaviour in the development branch. Both modules
will call UpdateInformation() before GetNumberOfOutputs().

Here is another tip on writing VTK readers:

* In your reader class, do not make calls that update the reader's MTime
anywhere other than ExecuteInformation() and SetXXX() methods. For
example, the reader should not call SetNumberOfOutputs() or
SetNthOutput() in GetNumberOfOutputs(). If you do this, the following
will call ExecuteInformation() twice:

reader UpdateInformation
reader GetNumberOfOutputs
reader UpdateInformation

This should not happen normally since UpdateInformation() calls
ExecuteInformation() only if the reader's MTime is newer than
the last ExecuteInformation() MTime.

Subject: [Paraview] failed build on AIX
Message-ID: <20031008213710.GI23594@molly.ece.pdx.edu>

Hi all!

  I'm trying to build VTK & ParaView on an IBM 690 and have run into
  several problems. If anyone has general help about working with AIX
  that would be appreciated, but the specific list of problems I've
  run into is:

  1) in building ParaViewComplete06 elements of the Wrapping code for
  tcl are missing.

  2) I get MPCI errors when trying to use the mpcc and mpCC_r
  compilers to take advantage of the multinode system I'm building on.

  I've tried the cvs version from this morning, but get similar
  errors.

  At this moment, I'm at a loss for what to do. I've just started
  using these tools, but it seems that cmake doesn't behave nicely on
  the system i'm using (not sure if this is term type problem or not).
  Also I'm not terribly savy with using and subsequently modifying the
  output of cmake.

  Any help is appreciated.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0310081922590.6634-100000@kingfisher.pmel.noaa.gov>

Just a follow-up on an old thread (2003-March/000123.html):

Georg got stereo in Windows, but when I tried the following on my linux
installation, in the command window:

RenWin1 StereoCapableWindowOn
RenWin1 SetStereoTypeToCrystalEyes
RenWin1 StereoRenderOn

it failed with:

Adjusting stereo mode on a window that does not
support stereo type CRYSTAL_EYES
is not possible.

Even though I've got a nVidia Quadro card, and I'm running the nVidia 
video driver binary (I know, I'm a bad person).

I changed lines 51-53 of vtkRenderWindow.cxx to:
  this->StereoType = VTK_STEREO_CRYSTAL_EYES;
  this->StereoStatus = 0;
  this->StereoCapableWindow = 1;
and re-compiled,
and now can set StereoRenderOn or StereoRenderOff in the command window.

We're considering a small cluster for computation and visualization here 
at PMEL, and wonder if stereo might be a feature when in 
distributed-rendering mode?

Cheers,
Chris

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0310081941350.6634-100000@kingfisher.pmel.noaa.gov>

I was hoping to run ParaView in a poor-man's collaborative mode by having 
each remote user have a copy of the data source, and have a script to 
repeatedly read the other user's location and render a simple avatar.

Any ideas on how this might best be done?  A socket?  or perhaps just
http?  Might I be able to run it as a separate thread so it doesn't
interefere with user interaction in the render window?  Perhaps someone's
already coded a slick version, keeping loads of my junky, hacked code from
flooding this email list?  I'm a fair C programmer, but my Tcl-scripting's 
pretty lame.

Cheers,
Chris

I can confirm to the list that the change made by Berk last night fixed 
the problem. Writing readers should now be bullet-proof. :-)

Hi,

First thanks for making this high quality software available.

My questions:

- When sampling data along a line, is there a way to display the data along 
the physical length (instead of "line division") ?

- Can the number of curves displayed in the diagram be controlled (except 
through the input file) ?

Best regards

A few suggestions:

1. Make sure you have the latest CMake release

2. Compile ParaView 1.0.2 (I know it's alpha but
it's pretty stable. We will do a beta or release
soon)

3. Try using standard compilers instead of mpcc.
These tend be wrappers around normal compilers anyway.
They usually add a few compiler flags. You should
be able to add these manually. I am suggesting this
because CMake might not set the flags for mpcc properly

4. Describe the errors you get in more detail. Copy and
past part of the output into your e-mail if necessary 

5. Describe the cmake problems you encounter in more
detail

6. Keep asking questions until you get the answers you
need :-)

Message-ID: <20031009174759.GM23594@molly.ece.pdx.edu>

Thanks for the reply. I've got a few questions about the overall
proceedure before I give it another go:
 
1) I know little to nothing about AIX and its compilers, but based on
   what I saw at the NCSA's site for their IBM 690s I need to use mpcc
   and mpCC for doing 32-bit mpi work. I'm trying to build the
   software so that it will take advantage of the multinode system.  
   Can be done without the use of MPI (i.e. just use the xlc_r and gcc
   compilers)?

2) Related to 1), do I need to worry about compiling tcl/tk and vtk
   with special compilers, or (vtk specific) is setting the option
   VTK_USE_PARALLEL going to be "enough"? Apparently the tcl configure
   script doesn't find the pthreads lib and header even though they're
   in /usr/lib and /usr/include, and I didn't see what I considered a
   safe place to add the flags in the Makefile that configure
   generated (this was using xlc and gcc) on copper.ncsa.uiuc.edu, so
   if I will need to build it with threads for the multinode use, a
   suggestion about where to add the gcc flags would be useful.

Thank you in advance for any help/education you can provide. This
looks like an extremely cool set of tools, I can't wait to get this
stuff working.

Hi Stephern,

This will not directly label the contour values, but if you display the
scalar bar, you will see aproximate values.

ParaView does not compile with VTK 4.2.3. You have three options:

1. Download ParaView 1.0.2 from the web (or wait until next
week for ParaView 1.0.3). The distribution contains the right
versions of Tcl/Tk, VTK and ParaView (highly recommended)

2. Obtain the release version of ParaViewComplete through CVS
(recommended if you don't have access to http):

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.paraview.org:/cvsroot/ParaView login
(respond with password paraview) 

Follow this command by checking out the source code:
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.paraview.org:/cvsroot/ParaView co -r
ParaView-1-0 ParaViewComplete

3. Obtain the development version of ParaViewComplete (same
as above, except no -r ParaView-1-0) (not recommended since we
are making some big changes and the development version might
be unstable)

I have another question. I followed all steps indicated by Berk for a 
local reader, compiled in my vtkLocal. My XML file indicates that the 
reader is found in <Library name="vtkLocalTCL"/> and everything works as 
advertised.

The problem happens in client-server mode. It happens that my reader 
uses a commercial library only available under Linux. I have compiled it 
under my Linux platform and wish to connect a Windows-based Paraview 
client to my Linux platform where ParaView runs in server mode. Can I do 
it? It seems not, since it is the client which parses the XML stuff, 
while [as I understand] it is the server which actually reads the data.

Any hints would be appreciated. TIA.

Errrrr.... hmmmm... With a small change you should be able to.
We are changing ParaView so that the readers/filters are not
created on the client. Therefore, the library does not have to
be loaded. The problem is line 681 of vtkPVXMLPackageParser:

this->Window->GetPVApplication()->BroadcastScript(
 "::paraview::load_component %s [file dirname [info nameofexecutable]]",
 name);

Try changing BroadcastScript to ServerScript. It should work.
If it doesn't, it's a bug we need to fix. If it does, let me know,
I'll commit the change.

PS. This does not work on the release branch.

Chris,

Did you check your X windows configuration?
In particular, the "Device" section should have a line:

   Option "Stereo" x

where x is the stereo option supported by your graphics
card (in your case, for CrystalEyes, probably 3).

hello there,

just wondering if anybody could explain to me how to do the following:

"ParaView provides many other data sources and filters by default (edge
extraction, surface extraction, reflection, decimation, extrusion,
smoothing...) and any VTK filter can be added by providing a simple XML
description (VTK provides hundreds of sources and filters, see VTK
documentation for a complete list). "

I would like to add the vtkDelaunay3D filter to the available filters in
paraview? The documentation of paraview/vtk doesn't seem to cover
how to extend paraview?

Select the contour filter in the Selection window, switch to
display, select Property to Color By, click on Actor Color
and select the color you want. However, this will change
the color of all iso-lines. If you want to color each iso-line
by a different color depending on it's value, you can Color By
that array and change the color map (using Edit Color Map
in Display page).

Subject: [Paraview] W2K mpi run
Message-ID: <3F8C2052.6030903@cscs.ch>

Dear all,

for a demo on a standalone laptop, I am trying to recreate an example 
where mpirun would run at least 2 processes for the server and have one 
client connect to it, all on the laptop and a single display.

It almost runs out of the box, but when compositing in on, it creates 
two OpenGL windows stuck in the upper left corner of my display and I 
cannot move them. The end result is that 1 window is completely obscured 
and compositing gets only trashed data.

Is there something in setup that I have missed to be able to move the 
windows freely on the screen?

I use mpich.nt.1.2.5, and the latest CVS of VTK and ParaView.

Other problem: If I use guiMPIRun, my satellite windows don't appear at 
all, so the display is completely boggus.

Any hints?
Thanks

You did not miss anything. There is no way to do it as far as I know.
I never investigated why this happens. I guess it has something to
do with the way the window is created (and also probably with the
fact that there is no event loop). If you have more than one window
on one display, you have to use offscreen rendering.


> Other problem: If I use guiMPIRun, my satellite windows don't appear at

Yeah, I have seen this happen. You have to change the property of
the mpich service (I think there is a check box that reads "allow
interaction with desktop" or something similar). Make sure that you
restart the service afterwards.

Hi,

Using the paraview script I am trying to do some repetitive tasks. It is =

than 100. Can you give som clue on this ?

for {set i 100} {$i < 500} {set i [expr $i + 1]} {
$kw(vtkTemp1) SetCurrentPVSourceCallback $kw(vtkTemp531)
$kw(vtkTemp541) SetValue C:/TestImages/PITCT/l7509.dr.$i

Here are a few tips to get started:

1. Read
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2003-September/000290.html
Adding filter is very similar to adding readers.

2. Read ParaView/Resources/Filters.xml in the source distribution.
This is the default filters config file for ParaView.

3. If you still have questions after you read 1 and 2, post them
to the mailing list. I'll try to answer them

hi there,

thanks for the help. here again for future references, to get the
vtkDelaunay3D filter working i did:

-define the extensions directory and setting the PV_INTERFACE_PATH
variable to the new directory
-added a file called myfilters.xml which contains:
<ModuleInterfaces>
<Module name="Delaunay3D" root_name="Delaunay3D" module_type="Filter">
  <Filter class="vtkDelaunay3D">
     <Input name="Input" class="vtkPointSet"/>
  </Filter>
  <InputMenu label="Input" help="Delaunay Triangulation"/>
  <VectorEntry variable="Tolerance" trace_name="Tolerance" type="float"
help="The tolerance" default_value="0.001" data_range="1.0"/>
  <VectorEntry variable="Alpha" trace_name="Alpha" type="float" help="The
Alpha value" default_value="2.0" data_range="10.0"/>
  <VectorEntry variable="Offset" trace_name="Offset" type="float"
help="The Offset value" default_value="2.5" data_range="10.0"/>
</Module>
</ModuleInterfaces>


however, i noticed that when i tried to save my filtered
data in vtk legacy (.vtk)  or unstructured grid (.vtu) file
format, paraview complained that the file name wasn't set,
if i tried to save it somewhere in "C:\program files\....",
but worked (frequent unix/w*dos problem?) if i save it in "C:\" directly.

cheers

For completeness, you may want to add one more of the public variable.

<LabeledToggle variable="BoundingTriangulation" 
trace_name="BoundingTriangulation" help="controls whether bounding 
triangulation points (and associated triangles) are included in the 
output" default_value="0"/>

Note also that your data ranges should include 2 values as in 
data_range="0.0 10.0"

yes, of course. thanks for the info.

can wrap the vtkVRMLExporter into paraview?

Subject: [Paraview] UpdateParameterWidgets() after Oct 6th
Message-ID: <AC89BDA1E3CCBC42B9CA5B50FE7934D30216700C@es10snlnt.sandia.gov>

All,

Context: Using the vtksnl exodus reader with paraview (main trunk after Oct
6th)

After the ParaView-WidgetSeparation-part1-trunk-post-merge1 tag (Oct 6th),
the function vtkPVSource::UpdateParameterWidgets() no longer seems to
generate calls to GetFilePrefix() or GetFilePattern() to the
vtkPExodusReader.

Here's the callstack for paraview ^before^ Oct 6th

I'm sorry for giving a criptic problem report but I found it almost
impossible to try to do any type of debugging whatsoever, the depth of this
call stack and the practice of having tcl code call c code which than calls
tcl code which than calls c code is enough to drive a man to drink.... :)

Dear All:

I have loaded a PLOT3D grid file(.xyz) and
it has inner surface such as mountain.
But it only shows outline box.
Is there any way I can see the inner surface
in the box?

Does it use blanking? Can I see the file? Blanking is currently
not supported in ParaView. I am working on that now.

I added the 3rd coord (z=0). In 3d I used tetrahedra thus 4 vertices,
what do I put for for the 4th vertex for my 2d data (pview expects 4
vertices)?

This has been fixed in 1.0.3 (which we just released).

Hi,
I have tried ParaView 1.02 and 1.03 . They still fail to read my .pvtk files ,but the 0.6 version can do it correctly.
How can I check the bug in source code and modify it?
Thanks a lot.

Hi Brian,

The problem is that gets are not called on the source any more. What we
need to do is to provide a special widget for setting file information.
I will look into that.

Trying to build paraview for a friend on an IBM I690 and get the following 
error that I dont know
how to fix:

"vtkbwidget.h", line 1469.1: 1540-0872 (s) A string literal cannot be 
longer than 32765.

I guess there is a long string in vtkbwidget.h. Anyone in AIX land know if 
there is a compiler
switch that will allow longer literals? I could not find one. Anyone in 
paraview land want to fix
the issue in vtkbwidget.h and send me a copy?? :).

As long as we are here.. This is a shared memory machine but I see no 
pthreads library. Other
than mpi is there a way to get parallelism with paraview on such a beast? 
As you can see I
am not familiar with this particular platform.

ParaView supports parallelism only through MPI. IBM's native
MPI library probably uses shared memory under the hood though.

You have to change two files to fix this:
Widgets/vtkbwidgets.h
Widgets/vtkKWBWidgets.h

You'll see that it already breaks the bwidgets string into 4
(bwidgets1, bwidgets2, bwidgets3 and bwidgets4). You have to
break them into more pieces. Once you get it working, send
me the fix, I'll put it in ParaView proper.

Hi Jarmo and all,

I am experiencing a paraview MPI compile failure

I have LAM-MPI from the red hat linux 8.0 distro.

ccmake finds the mpi executable and library OK
Paths are correct.

I see there is a cmake flag called MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY
I have NOT FOUND for this.

Could that be a problem?

my make fails at this point.

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[5]: *** =20
[/home/model/Desktop/paraview-cvs/ParaViewComplete/bin/pvtk] Error 1
make[4]: *** [default_target] Error 2
make[3]: *** [default_target_Wrapping_Tcl] Error 2
make[2]: *** [default_target] Error 2
make[1]: *** [default_target_VTK] Error 2
make: *** [default_target] Error 2
[model@modeling ParaViewComplete]$

here is my CMakeCache.txt, make by ccmake .

are there any obvious mistakes?

cheers

Dan

Dear Berk:

The grid file is binary and it does not use I blanking.
And eventually I'm going to use PLOT3D function file but
it is not supported in ParaView currently.
So temporarily, I used some alternative ways to express inner
surface and data which I want to see.
First, I wrote the interest data in 'q' file.
The contents in 'q' file become density, u, v, w, p instead of
the original 'q' file contents such as momemtum, stagnation
energy.
And then, I opened grid data and q file.
And I used filters such as 'Extract Surface', 'Clip' to express
inner space.
These are the steps I have taken.
Please let me know if you have any other idea and will be the
PLOT3D function file reader included in your future version?
Thank you very much.

Hi,

You must fill this MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY flag with the path to the library 
liblam.a . It should be "/usr/lib/liblam.a".

Hi,

anyone know what is causing this paraview MPI compile error,
on RedHat Linux 8.0

Using ccmake options


MPI on
shared libs off
correct paths to MPI stuff
using tclsh in paraview distro
using tlc in paraview distro

cheers

Dan

Oops. It looks like we broke something. ParaView does not compile
unless Patented is turned on. We will fix that today. Thanks
for the info. By the way, why are you using the development version 
from CVS? Unless you are _really_ interested in a new feature that 
is only in the development version, I strongly recommend using the 
1.0.3 release. We try to keep the development version stable all 
the time but there are days when it is broken.

Subject: [Paraview] broken build (it seems)
Message-ID: <20031024191528.GA4751@molly.ece.pdx.edu>

still trying to build paraview complete on an aix 5.1 system.

I'm currently getting an error that while :
'Building object file vtkParse.tab.o ...
ld: 0711-317 ERROR: Undefined symbol: .main'

Something is either hosed with my CMake config, or the makefile it
produces.  There are two things that I've tried.

1) specifying the xlc and xlC compilers (rather than the mpcc and mpCC
  ones) , but I'm not sure where to place the CXXFLAGS for the extra
includes/libraries i need to do an mpi build. I tried building the file
that was failing, by locally running gmake and it complained for each
of the things i'd put in CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and CMAKE_C_FLAGS that
/bin/sh couldn't find them. The string i set each of the CMAKE_?_FLAGS
to was
-I/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/include;-lmpi;-lvtd;-L/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/lib;-L/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/lib/ip

2) just using the mpcc and mpCC compilers without any values specified
in CMAKE_?_FLAGS.

both approaches give me the error that '.main' is not found when
compiling ParaViewComplete/VTK/Wrapping/vtkWrapTcl.c when i run make
from within ParaViewComplete .

any help is most appreciated.

Hi,

You must fill this MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY flag with the path to the library=20
liblam.a . It should be "/usr/lib/liblam.a".

How can I set the  scalar range to represent only the selected data object ?
I suppose there is a solution using ResetScalarRange or ResetColorMap from
the command prompt, but there is no documentation how to use the command
prompt, or doing scripting. 
Is there enyone who can help me?

You can't do this currently. We wanted to add this feature for a while
but never got around doing it. As it is, ResetScalarRange resets
to the range of all arrays with the same name.

Subject: [Paraview] Reader for a Raw volume data Image file.
Message-ID: <1519a29151b262.151b2621519a29@drexel.edu>

Greetings,

I, am a student of Drexel University, Computer Science,  working on a research project which requires using a tool to be able to view 3d volume data.
This data is collected from MRI scans and is in the form of Raw .dat file. The first 2 lines of the file is the header, consisting of the image resolution and the format(float, double etc) of the volume data which follows.
I have been trying to use paraview to view the data, but it doesn't have the appropriate reader for it.
Can someone please tellme whether paraview has the capability to view that sort of a file or how should I go about tweaking it to display that sort of data?
Are there any other tools available which would directly read this data file ?

Thanks,

/Suchindra Sandhu.

Subject: [Paraview] custom xml for vtkContourFilter
Message-ID: <55753.195.83.126.10.1067436425.squirrel@mail.ill.fr>

Hi,

when writing the definition of a custom vtk filter in XML
for single int or float I use for example

 <VectorEntry variable="NeighborhoodSize" trace_name="NeighborhoodSize"
type="float" help="NeighborhoodSize" default_value="10" data_range="0
40.0"/>

for the vtkSurfaceReconstructionFilter.

However, if I want to follow this up with the vtkContourFilter as in
Examples/Modelling/Python/surfaceReconstruction.py to see
the surface using SetValue(0, 0.), what do I have to write in the XML
to set the values of "void  SetValue (int i, float value)"
Is it a mix of types?

Axel

I guess this is a good way of finding who uses which filters :-)
Seriously, I removed the XML for those two filters because they
were put there as a test and I didn't believe that they were
used. You can add them back by loading a package. Here is
what it should look like:

<ModuleInterfaces>
<Module name="Dilate"  root_name="Dilate"  module_type="Filter">
  <Filter class="vtkPVImageContinuousDilate3D">
    <Input name="Input" class="vtkImageData">
      <ArrayRequirement attribute="Point" components="1"/>
    </Input>
  </Filter>
  <InputMenu id="im" label="Input" help="Set the input to this filter."
input_name="Input"/>
  <ArrayMenu input_name="Input" attribute_type="Scalars" label="Scalars"
input_menu="im" number_of_components="1" help="Select the input scalars
to process."/>
  <VectorEntry label="Kernel Size" variable="KernelSize" type="int"
length="3" help="Determines the dilation neighborhood." default_value="1
1 1"/>
</Module>
                                                                                          <Module name="Erode"  root_name="Erode" module_type="Filter">
  <Filter class="vtkPVImageContinuousErode3D">
    <Input name="Input" class="vtkImageData">
      <ArrayRequirement attribute="Point" components="1"/>
    </Input>
  </Filter>
  <InputMenu id="im" label="Input" help="Set the input to this filter."
input_name="Input"/>
  <ArrayMenu input_name="Input" attribute_type="Scalars" label="Scalars"
input_menu="im" number_of_components="1" help="Select the input scalars
to process."/>
  <VectorEntry label="Kernel Size" variable="KernelSize" type="int"
length="3" help="Determines the erosion neighborhood." default_value="1
1 1"/>
</Module>
</ModuleInterfaces>

Create an .xml file and add a PV_INTERFACE_PATH variable that points to
the directory where that file is to your environment. ParaView will try
to load all .xml files in that directory.

By the way, why are you using the CVS development version? If you are
using ParaView for production work, you should use the 1.0.3 release.
We are doing some serious overhaul and the development tree might not 
be always stable.

There is a special widget for setting contour values. It is
called ContourEntry. Here is how it is used in the default
contour module:

  <ContourEntry label="Contour Values" trace_name="Contour Values"
                help="List of current contour values. "/>

(1.0.3 release, this changed slightly in the development version)
The VectorEntry widget requires having a Set/Get pair and SetXXX
has to to take only one argument.

VolView is much better for that. It has a "light" mode that is
free. It should open your data out-of-the-box. I visualizes
volume data using volume rendering (which ParaView does not
support). Visit

I'm receiving the following error for both the downloaded Linux binary
distribution and my own compiled version of Paraview 1.0.3 

 

X Error of failed request:  GLXBadRenderRequest

  Major opcode of failed request:  142 (GLX)

  Minor opcode of failed request:  1 (X_GLXRender)

  Serial number of failed request:  730

  Current serial number in output stream:  736

 

Switching to Mesa cured the problem, but is unfortunately dead slow.

 

My configuration:

            SuSE 8.2 (kernel 2.4.20-4GB)

            gcc 3.3

 

            Graphics:

nVidia Corporation Quadro4 500/550 XGL (10de@0178):4:nvidia:16:glx::::

            Driver:   nvidia Version 1.0.4996

 

Is this a common problem with NVidia, and if so, is there a know workaround?

BTW: I did have paraview 0.6 working at home with the same driver.

 

 

Cheers,

I run ParaView on nVidia cards all the time (my desktop is Mandrake 9.1
GeForce2 drivers 1.0-4496) and never encountered this problem. Does it
happen at startup or when you do something specific?

Hi,

in the same context, is there any way that the vtkProgrammableSource
of /Examples/Modelling/Python/reconstructSurface.py
can be wrapped/used in paraview? In particular,
the very handy snippet for reading xyz data.

# Read some points. Use a programmable filter to read them.
pointSource = vtk.vtkProgrammableSource()

def readPoints():
    output = pointSource.GetPolyDataOutput()
    points = vtk.vtkPoints()
    output.SetPoints(points)

    file = open(os.path.normpath(os.path.join(VTK_DATA_ROOT,
"Data/cactus.3337.pts")))

    line = file.readline()
    while line:
        data = string.split(line)
        if data and data[0] == 'p':
            x, y, z = float(data[1]), float(data[2]), float(data[3])
            points.InsertNextPoint(x, y, z)
        line = file.readline()

pointSource.SetExecuteMethod(readPoints)


This would be a handy input filter for ascii data points?

Hi Eric,

Is there any reason why you are not using 1.0.3 instead of 0.6?
I tested the install target of 1.0.3 and it works ok. It is possible
that the one for 0.6 is broken. If you don't want to move to 1.0.3,
I can see if I can fix the install target of 0.6.

You should use ParaViewComplete 1.0.3. ParaView 1.0.3 is not compatible
with VTK 4.2. There is no VTK 4.3. We call the development branch
between 4.2 and 4.4 (not released) 4.3.
